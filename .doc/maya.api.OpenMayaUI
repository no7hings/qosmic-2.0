    class M3dView(__builtin__.object)
     |  M3dView provides methods for working with 3D model views.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(...)
     |      x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature
     |  
     |  beginGL(...)
     |      (Deprecated: Please use Viewport 2.0 APIs instead.) beginGL() -> self
     |      
     |      Setup port for native OpenGL drawing calls.
     |  
     |  beginProjMatrixOverride(...)
     |      (Deprecated: Please use MHWRender::MRenderOverride instead.) beginProjMatrixOverride(projectionMatrix) -> self
     |      
     |      Begin overriding the projection matrix used in openGL drawing.
     |      This override is enabled until endProjMatrixOverride() is called.
     |      
     |      * projectionMatrix (MMatrix) - Projection matrix used in openGL drawing
     |  
     |  beginSelect(...)
     |      beginSelect(buffer=None, size=0) -> self
     |      
     |      Start selecting. The buffer passed is used to record selection hits.
     |      
     |      * buffer (bytearray) - OpenGl pick buffer
     |      * size (int) - Buffer size
     |  
     |  beginXorDrawing(...)
     |      beginXorDrawing(drawOrthographic=True, disableDepthTesting=True, lineWidth=1.0, stipplePattern=kStippleNone, lineColor=MColor(1, 1, 1)) -> self
     |      
     |      Setup the context for exclusive-or (XOR) drawing.
     |      
     |      In XOR drawing the color values of the pixels being drawn is exclusive-ored with the color values already present in the view. The advantage of this is that exclusive-oring the same pixels with the same color values a second time will restore the pixels to their original colors, making it possible to temporarily display and erase lines without having to redraw the entire view. This makes XOR drawing particularly useful for drawing guidelines for tools.
     |      
     |      One disadvantage of XOR drawing is that the final color after the exclusive-or will not match your drawing color, except when the original color of the pixel was black. For example, XORing a white line across a red background will result in a cyan line and XORing it across a changing background will result in a line of changing colors. However in most situations where you would use XOR drawing the color of the lines is irrelevant just so long as they are visible.
     |      
     |      It is an error to call beginXorDrawing() again before calling endXorDrawing() first.
     |      
     |      * drawOrthographic (bool) - Draw using orthographic projection. Default is True.
     |      * disableDepthTesting (bool) - Disable depth testing during draw. Default is True.
     |      * lineWidth (float) - Set up line width. Default is 1.
     |      * stipplePattern (int) - Line stipple pattern. Default is kStippleNone.
     |      * lineColor (MColor) - Line color. Default is white (1,1,1).

     |  
     |  connectToRotationCenterPlug(...)
     |      connectToRotationCenterPlug(rotationCenterPlug) -> self
     |      
     |      Create a 1-1 association of the rotation center on the manipulator and the rotationCenterPlug parameter.  When both the rotation center is attached to a plug and the displayWithNode() method has been called, the manipulator will display with the node regardless of the connection made to the rotation center.
     |      
     |      The plug must have a data type of MFnNumericData.k3Double.
     |      
     |      * rotationCenterPlug (MPlug) - The plug to connect the rotation center to
     |  
     |  connectToRotationPlug(...)
     |      connectToRotationPlug(rotationPlug) -> self
     |      
     |      Create a 1-1 connection from the rotation manipVal to the rotationPlug parameter.  Any changes to the rotation manipVal will be immediately reflected in the connected plug.  Connecting to the "rotation" plug on a transform node will produce similar behavior to the built-in rotation manipulator.
     |      
     |      The plug must have a data type of MFnNumericData.k3Double.
     |      
     |      * rotationPlug (MPlug) - The plug to connect the rotation value to
     |  
     |  create(...)
     |      create(manipName=None, rotationName=None) -> MObject
     |      
     |      Creates a new RotateManip, and attaches this function set to the new manipulator.
     |      
     |      This method should only be used to create a non-composite manipulator, meaning that the manipulator is standalone and not part of a container.
     |      
     |      When the manipulator is being used, the feedback line will display a string including rotationName, indicating that this manipulator is in use.
     |      
     |      * manipName (string) - Name of the manip for UI purposes.
     |      * rotationName (string) - Label for the rotation value displayed in the feedback line.
     |  
     |  displayWithNode(...)
     |      displayWithNode(node) -> self
     |      
     |      Configures the manipulator to display with the node, causing the position of the manipulator to follow the position of the node whenever the node is moved.  The node must be a DAG object.
     |      
     |      * node (MObject) - The node the manipulator should display with
     |  
     |  rotationCenterIndex(...)
     |      rotationCenterIndex() -> int
     |      
     |      Returns the index of the rotation center for this manipulator.
     |      
     |      Note that the rotation center is only used for positioning the display of the manipulator, and has no effect on the rotation values generated by the manipulator.
     |  
     |  rotationIndex(...)
     |      rotationIndex() -> int
     |      
     |      Returns the index of the rotation manipVal for the manipulator.  When plugToManip conversion functions are used to produce the rotation manipVal, the manipulator data must be of the type MFnNumericData.k3Double, with X,Y, and Z rotations given in radians.  This is easily accomplished by using the MEulerRotation class to manage the rotations.
     |  
     |  setInitialRotation(...)
     |      setInitialRotation(rotation) -> self
     |      
     |      Sets the initial rotation for the rotate manipulator.  Setting the initial rotation will prevent the manipulator from jumping back to the default rotation when there is already an existing rotation on the target plug.
     |      
     |      * rotation (MEulerRotation) - The initial rotation
     |  
     |  setRotationCenter(...)
     |      setRotationCenter(rotationCenter) -> self
     |      
     |      Sets the position of the rotation center for the manipulator.
     |      
     |      The value set by this method is ignored if a plug has been connected to the rotationCenterPlug. This value is only relevant when there is no plug connection to rotationCenterPlug nor node associated with the manip (see connectToRotationCenterPlug and displayWithNode, respectively).
     |      
     |      Note that the rotation center is only used for positioning the display of the manipulator, and has no effect on the rotation values generated by the manipulator.
     |      
     |      * rotationCenter (MPoint) - The world space position of the rotation center.

     |  Data descriptors defined here:
     |  
     |  isSnapModeOn
     |      Whether or not the snap mode is on. When snap mode is on, rotation manip values will snap to the values within some increment apart.
     |  
     |  rotateMode
     |      The mode for the rotation manipulator.  The manipulator mode controls the appearance of the manipulator when is it used.
     |      
     |      The following modes are supported for the rotation manipulator:
     |      
     |      * kObjectSpace In object space mode, the manipulator is displayed as three perpendicular manipulator discs, as well as a view disc enclosing the manipulator.  The manipulator will rotate whenever the manip value is changed.
     |      * kWorldSpace This mode forces the manipulator to display in the default orientation regardless of the manipulator value.  The manipulator is displayed the same as in object space mode, except it does not rotate when the manip value is changed.
     |      * kGimbal In gimbal mode, only the constrained axis rotation discs are allowed to be manipulated.  Gimbal mode treats the X,Y, and Z axis rotations as a sequence of operations on the default manipulator display.  First, the X rotation is applied.  Then, the Y rotation is applied, causing the X rotation disc to become transformed.  Finally, the Z rotation is applied, transforming both the X and Y rotation discs.  The Z rotation disc remains fixed during the operation.  No view disc can be manipulated in gimbal mode.
     |  
     |  snapIncrement
     |      The snap increment is specified in degrees. Manipulator values will snap to the next rotation at an angle of snapIncrement from the original rotation.  Note that snap rotate does not apply to the trackball rotations (when dragging between the rotate discs).

     |  connectToScaleCenterPlug(...)
     |      connectToScaleCenterPlug(scaleCenterPlug) -> self
     |      
     |      Create a 1-1 association of the scale center on the manipulator and the scaleCenterPlug parameter.  When both the scale center is attached to a plug and the displayWithNode() method has been called, the manipulator will display with the node regardless of the connection made to the scale center.
     |      
     |      The plug must have a data type of MFnNumericData.k3Double.
     |      
     |      * scaleCenterPlug (MPlug) - The plug to connect the scale center to

     |  connectToScalePlug(...)
     |      connectToScalePlug(scalePlug) -> self
     |      
     |      Create a 1-1 connection from the scale manipVal to the scalePlug parameter.  Any changes to the scale manipVal will be immediately reflected in the connected plug.  Connecting to the "scale" plug on a transform node will produce similar behavior to the built-in scale manipulator.
     |      
     |      The plug must have a data type of MFnNumericData.k3Double.
     |      
     |      * scalePlug (MPlug) - The plug to connect the scale value to
     |  
     |  create(...)
     |      create(manipName=None, scaleName=None) -> MObject
     |      
     |      Creates a new ScaleManip, and attaches this function set to the new manipulator.
     |      
     |      This method should only be used to create a non-composite manipulator, meaning that the manipulator is standalone and not part of a container.
     |      
     |      When the manipulator is being used, the feedback line will display a string including scaleName, indicating that this manipulator is in use.
     |      
     |      * manipName (string) - Name of the manip for UI purposes.
     |      * scaleName (string) - Label for the scale value displayed in the feedback line.
     |  
     |  displayWithNode(...)
     |      displayWithNode(node) -> self
     |      
     |      Configures the manipulator to display with the node, causing the position of the manipulator to follow the position of the node whenever the node is moved.  The node must be a DAG object.
     |      
     |      * node (MObject) - The node the manipulator should display with
     |  
     |  scaleCenterIndex(...)
     |      scaleCenterIndex() -> int
     |      
     |      Returns the index of the scale center manipVal for this manipulator.
     |      
     |      Note that the scale center is only used for display of the manipulator and has no effect on scale values produced by the manipulator.
     |  
     |  scaleIndex(...)
     |      scaleIndex() -> int
     |      
     |      Returns the index of the scale manipVal for this manipulator.
     |  
     |  setInitialScale(...)
     |      setInitialScale(scale) -> self
     |      
     |      Sets the initial scale for the scale manipulator.  Setting the initial scale will prevent the manipulator from jumping back to the default scale when there is already an existing scale on the target plug.
     |      
     |      * scale (MVector) - The initial scale

     |  getAvailableImages(...)
     |      getAvailableImages(context, uvSetName) -> list of string/None
     |      
     |      Maya will call this method to get your shader's list of images which are available for use in the UV texture editor for the UV set specified. Typically, this list will include one entry for each texture using the specified UV set, however, your shader is free to return as many images as you wish (for example, blending between two textures, texture alpha masks, artificially shaded views of bump/normal maps, etc). Your shader's renderImage() method will be used to render the images themselves.
     |      
     |      * context (ShaderContext) - Context of the draw request (e.g. the surface being shaded, shading engine making the request)
     |      * uvSetName (string) - Name of a UV set the channel list should be filtered against.
     |      
     |      Returns the names of the images this shader defines which are valid for the uvSetName specified.
     |      Returns None if method is not implemented : Use the default behaviour.
     |  
     |  profile(...)
     |      profile() -> MRenderProfile
     |      
     |      Override this method to specify the renderers your shader supports. If this method is not overridden, Maya will assume your shader supports only Maya's iternal OpenGL based renderer.
     |      
     |      Note that this method is called inside the rendering loop and as such, you should make this method as fast as possible - typically just returning a static/precalculated value.
     |      
     |      Return a reference to the render profile for this Shader. Your shader class should create this once (usually for the whole class) and return the same object each time this method is called.
     |  
     |  renderImage(...)
     |      renderImage(context, imageName, region, parameters) -> [int, int]/None
     |      renderImage(context, uiDrawManager, imageName, region, parameters) -> [int, int]/None
     |      
     |      This method allows you to to render the background image used for this shader in the UV texture editor. The image requested will be one of the image names returned by your shader's getAvailableImages() method.
     |      
     |      The implementation must return the dimensions of the image in the 'imageWidth' and 'imageHeight' parameters so that Maya can perform pixel snapping and other resolution-dependent operations.
     |      
     |      The implementation can assume OpenGL context, model view projection matrix, and texture transformations have already been set. A default color of white will be set, however you are free to change this. The magnification filter will be set to either point or bilinear based on user configuration and should not be modified. The values of GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S and GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T are undefined on entry, and your implementation is responsible for setting them to appropriate values (e.g. GL_REPEAT).
     |      
     |      The arguments contain the name of the image to render, and the vertex and texture coordinate values to use at each corner of the rectangular image being rendered. Your implementation is responsible for restoring the original the value of any OpenGL state that is modified.
     |      
     |      * context (ShaderContext) - Context of the draw request (e.g. the surface being shaded, shading engine making the request)
     |      * imageName (string) - Name of the image to render. This corresponds to one of the image names returned by your shader's getAvailableImages() method.
     |      * region (float[2][2]) - Rectangular region to be rendered. The values of this parameter should be used to populate the vertex and texture coordinates of the rectangle being rendered.
     |      * parameters (RenderParamters) - Additional parameters on how to render the image. The values reflect the image settings of the UV editor.
     |      
     |      A second version with the uiDrawManager parameter allows you to to render the background image used for this shader in the UV texture editor in viewport 2.0.
     |      
     |      * uiDrawManager (MUIDrawManager) - The UI draw manager, it can be used to draw some simple geometry
     |      
     |      Returns None if method is not implemented : No rendering will occur.
     |  
     |  renderSwatchImage(...)
     |      renderSwatchImage(image) -> self
     |      
     |      If the shader specifies to override swatch rendering, then this method must be overridden in order to draw anything into a swatch.
     |      
     |      The shader will only draw a swatch if it has been registered to do so, by providing a valid classification during MFnPlugin::registerNode(). The shader should provide a classification that defines a swatch rendering node such as : "shader/surface/utility/:drawdb/shader/surface/myCustomShader:swatch/myCustomShaderSwatchGenerator" and have "myCustomShaderSwatchGenerator" registered has a swatch renderer : MSwatchRenderRegister.registerSwatchRender("myCustomShaderSwatchGenerator", MHWShaderSwatchGenerator.createObj );
     |      
     |      The default implementation is to draw nothing. The basic logic to draw a swatch is as follows:
     |      
     |        Determine the size of the swatch required. This is the dimensions of the MImage passed in as an argument. The pixels for the MImage will have been pre-allocated. The format of the pixels is 32-bit R,G,B,A, with 8-bits per channel.
     |        Either use an offscreen "swatch context" provided to you or use your own offscreen context. The provided context is available via the MHardwareRenderer class method makeSwatchContextCurrent(). Note that the swatch context may be smaller than the desired image size. In this case the rendering dimensions will be clamped.
     |        Either use swatch geometry provided to you, or use your own swatch geometry. The provided geometry is available via the method MHardwareRenderer::referenceDefaultGeometry(). The possible "default" geometries are either a sphere, cube or plane.
     |        Either use the provided "default" light and "default" camera or set up your own. Use the methods (getSwatchOrthoCameraSetting(), getSwatchLightDirection()) on MHardwareRenderer to get these defaults.
     |        Read back the swatch context into the provided MImage. The convenience method MHardwareRenderer::readSwatchContextPixels() can be used. By default the format of the MImage and the swatch context are the same, so the user does not need to worry about this. The context will read into the pre-allocated MImage pixels.
     |        Unreference any swatch geometry used for rendering using MHardwareRenderer::dereferenceGeometry().
     |      
     |      * image [IN/OUT] (MImage) - Image object to which this method must write the rendered swatch. On input the image's dimensions are already set and pixel storage already allocated.
     |      
     |      Returns None if method is not implemented : No rendering will occur.
     |  
     |  setUniformParameters(...)
     |      setUniformParameters(parameters, remapCurrentValues=True, dagModifier=None) -> self
     |      
     |      Call this method to set the list of uniform parameters this shader uses. Once set, you can use these parameters to access the cached values of shader parameters, including testing when the value has been updated (to minimise the shader state changes). When using this method to manage uniform parameters, Maya will handle the underlyintg attributes, serialization and user interface for you.It is important to call this method whenever the shader parameters are modified (including at load time).This is an optional method - shader implementations are still free to manage uniform (i.e. shader-level) parameters independently if they wish.* parameters (MUniformParameterList) - the list of uniform parameters for this shader
     |      * remapCurrentValues (bool) - if True (the default), Maya will attempt to initialise the value of new parameters based on any equivalently named parameters that currently exist on the node. Otherwise, the parameters will be setup using default values. Unless you wish to forcibly reset parameter values, the default value of True should be used.
     |      * dagModifier (MDagModifier) - an optional DG modifier to use when managing the attributes used to represent the geometry parameters on this shader.
     |  
     |  setVaryingParameters(...)
     |      setVaryingParameters(parameters, remapCurrentValues=True, dagModifier=None) -> self
     |      
     |      Call this method to set the list of varying parameters this shader uses. Once set, you can use these parameters directly to access geometry data for surfaces being shaded. When using this method to manage shader varying parameters, there is no need to override populateRequirements or handle the node interface as Maya will handle parameter setup, presentation and configuration for you.
     |      
     |      It is important to call this method whenever the shader parameters are modified (including at load time).
     |      
     |      This is an optional method - shader implementations are still free to manage geometry parameters independently if they wish.
     |      
     |      * parameters (MUniformParameterList) - the list of varying parameters for this shader
     |      * remapCurrentValues (bool) - if True (the default), Maya will attempt to initialise the value of new parameters based on any equivalently named parameters that currently exist on the node. Otherwise, the parameters will be setup using default values. Unless you wish to forcibly reset parameter values, the default value of True should be used.
     |      * dagModifier (MDagModifier) - an optional DG modifier to use when managing the attributes used to represent the geometry parameters on this shader.
     |  
     |  transparencyOptions(...)
     |      transparencyOptions() -> int
     |      
     |      This method returns transparency options for usage as hints for Maya's internal draw during a given rendering pass. Parameters are returned via an integer containing masked out bits. By default the mask is set to 0, meaning that the drawing should be treated as regular opaque object drawing. This will generally mean one call per draw pass.
     |      
     |      Options to control transparency are specified by returning one or more masks specified by the following values :
     |        - kIsTransparent : Draw as a transparent object. If no transparency overrides are specified, then control of how to draw during a given pass is determined internally by Maya's refresh algorithm, and options the user can set per modelling viewport.
     |        - kNoTransparencyFrontBackCull : When kisTransparent is set and this flag is set, do not perform transparency drawing using the internal 2-pass front-face + back-face culling algorithm.
     |        - kNoTransparencyPolygonSort : When kisTransparent is set and this flag is set, do not perform transparency drawing using the internal 2-pass drawing of back-to-front sorted triangles.

     |  
     |  addExternalContentForFileAttr(...)
     |      addExternalContentForFileAttr(table, attr) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is a helper for derived clases implementing getExternalContent().  It augments the external content info table passed in with an entry describing external content whose location is described by the specified attribute.
     |      
     |      The method will not overwrite existing items, i.e. items with the same key. (attribute name).  In this context, overwriting an item means the caller has called this function twice with the same attribute, or that two separate but identically named attributes were used.  If replacing an entry is the desired effect, it is the caller's responsibility to erase the previous item first.
     |      
     |      * table [OUT] (MExternalContentInfoTable) - table The table in which the new entry will be added.
     |      * attr (MObject) - The attribute for which the plug value will be queried for a location.
     |      
     |      Returns True if an item was sucessfully added to the table.  False if the attribute does not describe a non-empty location, or an item with the same key was already present in the table.
     |  
     |  compute(...)
     |      compute(plug, dataBlock) -> self
     |      
     |      This method should be overridden in user defined nodes.
     |      
     |      Recompute the given output based on the nodes inputs.  The plug represents the data value that needs to be recomputed, and the data block holds the storage for all of the node's attributes.
     |      
     |      The MDataBlock will provide smart handles for reading and writing this node's attribute values.  Only these values should be used when performing computations.
     |      
     |      When evaluating the dependency graph, Maya will first call the compute method for this node.  If the plug that is provided to the compute indicates that that the attribute was defined by the Maya parent node, the compute method should return None.  When this occurs, Maya will call the internal Maya node from which the user-defined node is derived to compute the plug's value. Returning any othervalue (including self) will tell Maya that this node successfully computed theplug. Raising an exception will tell Maya that this node failed at computingthe plug. Note that in most cases, Maya ignores node compute failures.
     |      
     |      In other words, the compute method should return None to get the Maya parent class to compute the plug. It should return self (or any other value) to indicate that the plug was computed successfully.
     |      
     |      This means that a user defined node does not need to be concerned with computing inherited output attributes.  However, if desired, these can be safely recomputed by this method to change the behaviour of the node.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug representing the attribute that needs to be recomputed.
     |      * block (MDataBlock) - data block containing storage for the node's attributes.
     |  
     |  connectionBroken(...)
     |      connectionBroken( plug, otherPlug, asSrc) -> self
     |      
     |      This method gets called when connections are broken with attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (bool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  connectionMade(...)
     |      connectionMade(plug, otherPlug, asSrc) -> self
     |      
     |      This method gets called when connections are made to attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (bool) - is this plug a source of the connection.

     |  copyInternalData(...)
     |      copyInternalData(node) -> self
     |      
     |      This method is overriden by nodes that store attribute data in some internal format.
     |      
     |      On duplication this method is called on the duplicated node with the node being duplicated passed as the parameter.  Overriding this method gives your node a chance to duplicate any internal data you've been storing and manipulating outside of normal attribute data.
     |      
     |      * node (MPxNode) - the node that is being duplicated.
     |  
     |  dependsOn(...)
     |      dependsOn( plug, otherPlug) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method may be overridden by the user defined node. It should only be required to override this on rare occasions.
     |      
     |      This method determines whether a specific attribute depends on another attribute.
     |      
     |      You should return None to specify that Maya should determines the dependency (default).
     |      
     |      This is mainly to define dependency of dynamic attributes, since attributeAffects does not work with dynamic attributes.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.

     |      doNotWrite() -> bool
     |      
     |      use this method to query the "do not write" state of this proxy node. True is returned if this node will not be saved when the maya model is written out.

     |      forceCache(ctx=MDGContext::current()) -> MDataBlock
     |      
     |      Get the datablock for this node. If there is no datablock then one will be created.
     |      NOTE: This should be used only in places where fast access to the datablock outside of a compute is critical such as the transformUsing method of MPxSurfaceShape.
     |      
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - The context in which the datablock will be retrieved.

     |      The table populated by this method must include the location of all the content (files) used by this node, including those that do not exist.  See MExternalContentInfoTable for details.
     |      
     |      Keys used to add items to this table will be the same that get passed to setExternalContent through its MExternalContentLocationTable parameter to perform a batched change of content location.
     |      
     |      When implementing getExternalContent, you are responsible for forwarding the call to the base class when it makes sense to do so, so that base classes  can also add their external content to the table.
     |      
     |      The default implementation does nothing.
     |      
     |      * table [OUT] (MExternalContentInfoTable) - Content information table that this method must populate.
     |  
     |  getFilesToArchive(...)
     |      getFilesToArchive(shortName=False, unresolvedName=False, markCouldBeImageSequence=False) -> list of strings
     |      
     |      Use this method to return all external files used by this node. This file list will be used by the File > Archive zip feature, maya.exe -archive and the `file -q -list` mel command.
     |      
     |      Only include files that exist.
     |      
     |      If shortName is True, return just the filename portion of the path. Otherwise, return a full path.
     |      
     |      If unresolvedName is True, return the path before any resolution has been done (i.e leave it as a relative path, include unexpanded environment variables,  tildes, ".."s etc). Otherwise, resolve the file     path and return an absolute path (to resolve with standard Maya path resolution, use MFileObject.resolvedFullName()).
     |      
     |      * shortName (bool) - If True, only add the filename of the path.
     |      * unresolvedName (bool) - If True, add paths before any resolution, rather than absolute paths.
     |      * markCouldBeImageSequence (bool) - If True, append an asterisk after any file path that could be an image sequence (note: only used by maya.exe -archive).
     |  
     |  getInternalValue(...)
     |      getInternalValue(plug, dataHandle) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is overridden by nodes that store attribute data in some internal format.
     |      
     |      The internal state of attributes can be set or queried using the setInternal and internal methods of MFnAttribute.
     |      
     |      When internal attribute values are queried via getAttr or MPlug.getValue() this method is called.
     |      
     |      All internal data should respect the current context, which may be obtained from MDGContext::current()
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being queried.
     |      * dataHandle [OUT] (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle to store the attribute value.
     |  
     |  getInternalValueInContext(...)
     |      getInternalValueInContext(plug, dataHandle, ctx) -> bool [OBSOLETE]
     |      
     |      This method is obsolete. Override MPxNode.getInternalValue instead.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being queried.
     |      * dataHandle [OUT] (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle to store the attribute value.
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - the context the method is being evaluated in.
     |  
     |  internalArrayCount(...)
     |      internalArrayCount(plug) -> int
     |      internalArrayCount(plug, ctx) -> int  [OBSOLETE]
     |      
     |      This method is overridden by nodes that have internal array attributes which are not stored in Maya's datablock. This method is used by Maya to determine the non-sparse count of array elements during file IO. If the internal array is stored sparsely, you should return the maximum index of the array plus one. If the internal array is non-sparse then return the length of the array.
     |      
     |      This method does not need to be implemented for attributes that are stored in the datablock since Maya will use the datablock size.
     |      
     |      If this method is overridden, it should return -1 for attributes which it does not handle. Maya will use the datablock size to determine the array length when -1 is returned.
     |      
     |      All internal data should respect the current context, which may be obtained from MDGContext.current()
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the array plug.
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - the context, default to MDGContext.current().
     |  
     |  isAbstractClass(...)
     |      isAbstractClass() -> bool
     |      
     |      Override this class to return True if this node is an abstract node. An abstract node can only be used as a base class.  It cannot be created using the 'createNode' command.
     |      
     |      It is not necessary to override this method.
     |  
     |  isPassiveOutput(...)
     |      isPassiveOutput(plug) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method may be overridden by the user defined node if it wants to provide output attributes which do not prevent value modifications to the destination attribute. For example, output plugs on animation curve nodes are passive. This allows the attributes driven by the animation curves to be set to new values by the user.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug representing output in question.
     |  
     |  legalConnection(...)
     |      legalConnection(plug, otherPlug, asSrc) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method allows you to check for legal connections being made to attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      You should return None to specify that maya should handle this connection if you are unable to determine if it is legal.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (bool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  legalDisconnection(...)
     |      legalDisconnection(plug, otherPlug, arsSrc) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method allows you to check for legal disconnections being made to attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      You should return None to specify that maya should handle this disconnection if you are unable to determine if it is legal.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (boool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  name(...)
     |      name() -> string
     |      
     |      Returns the name of this particular instance of this class.  Each objectin the dependency graph has a name.  This name will be used by the UIand by MEL.
     |      
     |      It is not necessary to override this method.
     |      
     |      Returns the name of the node
     |  
     |  passThroughToMany(...)
     |      passThroughToMany(plug, plugArray) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is overriden by nodes that want to control the traversal behavior of some Maya search algorithms which traverse the history/future of shape nodes looking for directly related nodes. In particular, the Artisan paint code uses this method when searching for paintable nodes, and the disk cache code uses this method when searching for upstream cacheFile nodes.
     |      
     |      If this method is not implemented or returns False, the base class Maya implementation of this method calls passThroughToOne and returns the results of that call.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the plug.
     |      * plugArray (MPlugArray) - the corresponding plugs.
     |  
     |  passThroughToOne(...)
     |      passThroughToOne(plug) -> plug
     |      
     |      This method may be overriden by nodes that have a one-to-one relationship between an input attribute and a corresponding output attribute. This method is used by Maya to perform the following capabilities:
     |      
     |      - When this node is deleted, the delete command will rewire the source of the input attribute to the destination of the output attribute if the source and destination are connected to nodes that are not deleted.
     |      - History traversal algorithms such as the bakePartialHistory command use this method to direct its traversal through a shape's construction history.
     |      - The base class Maya implementation of passThroughToAll will call this method if passThroughToAll returns False.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the plug.
     |  
     |  postConstructor(...)
     |      postConstructor() -> self
     |      
     |      Internally maya creates two objects when a user defined node is created, the internal MObject and the user derived object.
     |      The association between the these two objects is not made until after the MPxNode constructor is called. This implies that no MPxNode member function can be called from the MPxNode constructor.
     |      The postConstructor will get called immediately after the constructor when it is safe to call any MPxNode member function.
     |  
     |  postEvaluation(...)
     |      postEvaluation(context, evalNode, evalType) -> None
     |      
     |      Clean up node's internal state after threaded evaluation.
     |      
     |      After the evaluation graph execution, each node gets a chance to restore / update its internal states.For example, resetting draw state.
     |      
     |      This code has to be thread safe, non - blocking and work only on data owned by the node.
     |      
     |      This call will most likely happen from a worker thread.
     |      
     |      * context (MDGContext) - Context in which the evaluation is happening.
     |                               This should be respected and only internal state
     |                               information pertaining to it should be modified.
     |      * evaluationNode (MEvaluationNode) - Evaluation node which contains
     |                                           information about the dirty plugs the
     |                                           dirty plugs that were evaluated for this
     |                                           context.
     |      * evalType (PostEvaluationType)
     |        * kEvaluatedIndirectly : The node's compute function handled evaluation.
     |        * kEvaluatedDirectly   : Evaluation was performed externally and the results injected
     |                                 back into the node.  This would happen in situations such as
     |                                 extracting values from an external cache.The node needs to
     |                                 update any additional internal state based on the new values.
     |        * kLeaveDirty          : Evaluation was performed without updating this node. Internal
     |                                 state should be updated to reflect that the node is dirty.
     |  
     |  preEvaluation(...)
     |      preEvaluation(context, evalNode) -> None
     |      
     |      Prepare a node's internal state for threaded evaluation.
     |      
     |      During the evaluation graph execution each node gets a chance to reset its internal states just before being evaluated.
     |      
     |      This code has to be thread safe, non - blocking and work only on data owned by the node.
     |      
     |      The timing of this callback is at the discretion of evaluation graph dependencies and individual evaluators.This means, it should be used purely to prepare this node for evaluation and no particular order should be assumed.
     |      
     |      This call will most likely happen from a worker thread.
     |      
     |      * context (MDGContext) - Context in which the evaluation is happening.
     |                               This should be respected and only internal state
     |                               information pertaining to it should be modified.
     |      * evaluationNode (MEvaluationNode) - Evaluation node which contains
     |                                           information about the dirty plugs that
     |                                           are about to be evaluated for the context.
     |                                           Should be only used to query information.
     |  
     |  setDependentsDirty(...)
     |      setDependentsDirty(plug, plugArray) -> self
     |      
     |      This method can be overridden in user defined nodes to specify which plugs should be set dirty based upon an input plug which Maya is marking dirty. The list of plugs for Maya to mark dirty is returned by the plug array. This method handles both dynamic as well as non-dynamic plugs and is useful in the following ways:
     |      
     |      
     |      
     |      - Allows attributeAffects-style relationships to be handled for dynamically-added attributes. Since MPxNode.attributeAffects() can only be used with non-dynamic attributes, use of this method allows a way for all attributes of a node to affect one another, both dynamic and non-dynamic.
     |      
     |      - Provides more flexible relationships than what is available with MPxNode.attributeAffects(). For example, you may wish to not dirty plugs when the current frame is one. However, as the routine is called during dirty propagation, there are restrictions on what can be done within the routine, most importantly you must not cause any dependency graph computation. For details, see the IMPORTANT NOTE below.
     |      
     |      
     |      
     |      This method is designed to work harmoniously with MPxNode.attributeAffects() on the same node. Alternately, you can do all affects relationships within a yourNode.setDependentsDirty() implementation.
     |      
     |      The body of a user-implemented setDependentsDirty() implementation might look like the following example, which causes the plug called "B" to be set dirty whever plug "A" is changed, i.e. A affects B.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug which is being set dirty by Maya.
     |      * plugArray the programmer should add any plugs which they want to set dirty to this list.
     |  
     |  setDoNotWrite(...)
     |      setDoNotWrite(bool) -> self
     |      
     |      Use this method to mark the "do not write" state of this proxy node.  If set, this node will not be saved when the Maya model is written out. 
     |      
     |      NOTES:
     |      1. Plug-in "requires" information will be written out with the model when saved.  But a subsequent reload and resave of the file will cause these to go away.
     |      2. If this node is a DAG and has a parent or children, the "do not write" flag of the parent or children will not be set. It is the developer's responsibility to ensure that the resulting scene file is capable of being read in without errors due to unwritten nodes.
     |  
     |  setExternalContent(...)
     |      setExternalContent(table) -> self
     |      
     |      This is useful in the context of content relocation.  This will be called while the scene is being loaded to apply path changes performed externally. Consequently, interaction with the rest of the scene must be kept to a minimum.  It is however valid to call this method outside of scene loading contexts.
     |      
     |      The keys in the map must be the same as the ones provided by the node in getExternalContent.  The values are the new locations.
     |      
     |      When implementing setExternalContent, you are responsible for forwarding the call to the base class when it makes sense to do so, so that base classes  can also set their external content.
     |      
     |      The default implementation does nothing.
     |      
     |      * table Key->location table with new content locations.
     |  
     |  setExternalContentForFileAttr(...)
     |      setExternalContentForFileAttr(attr, table) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is a helper for derived clases implementing setExternalContent().  It assigns a value to a plug with the one from the table whose key is the same as the passed in attribute name.
     |      
     |      The method will not write to the plug if the attribute is not found in the  table.
     |      
     |      * attr (MObject) - The attribute of the plug we want to write to.
     |      * table (MExternalContentLocationTable) - A table which may hold or not the value for a given plug.
     |      
     |      Returns True if the plug was successfully written to. False if no entry in the table was named after the attribute or if no plug was found.
     |  
     |  setInternalValue(...)
     |      setInternalValue(plug, dataHandle) -> bool
     |      
     |      
     |      This method is overriden by nodes that store attribute data in some internal format.
     |      
     |      The internal state of attributes can be set or queried using the setInternal and internal methods of MFnAttribute.
     |      
     |      When internal attribute values are set via setAttr or MPlug.setValue() this method is called.
     |      
     |      Another use for this method is to impose attribute limits.
     |      
     |      All internal data should respect the current context, which may be obtained from MDGContext::current()
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being set.
     |      * dataHandle (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle containing the value to set.
     |  
     |  setInternalValueInContext(...)
     |      setInternalValueInContext(plug, dataHandle, ctx) -> bool  [OBSOLETE]
     |      
     |      This method is obsolete. Override MPxNode.setInternalValue instead.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being set.
     |      * dataHandle (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle containing the value to set.
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - the context the method is being evaluated in.
     |  
     |  setMPSafe(...)
     |      setMPSafe(bool) -> self
     |      
     |      This method is obsolete. Override MPxNode.setSchedulingType instead.
     |      
     |      Set a flag to specify if a user defined shading node is safe for multi-processor rendering. For a shading node to be MP safe, it cannot access any shared global data and should only use attributes in the datablock to get input data and store output data. 
     |      
     |      NOTE: This should be called from the postConstructor() method for shading node plug-ins only. If a shading node is non-safe, then it will only be useful during single processor rendering.
     |  
     |  shouldSave(...)
     |      shouldSave(plug) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method may be overridden by the user defined node.  It should only be required to override this on rare occasions.
     |      
     |      This method determines whether a specific attribute of this node should be written out during a file save.  The default behavior is to only write the value if it differs from the default and is not being supplied by a connection.  This behavior should be sufficient in most cases.
     |      This method is not called for ramp attributes since they should always be written.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug representing the attribute to be saved.
     |  
     |  thisMObject(...)
     |      thisMObject() -> MObject
     |      
     |      Returns the MObject associated with this user defined node.  This makes it possible to use MFnDependencyNode or to construct plugs to this node's attributes.
     |  
     |  type(...)
     |      type() -> int
     |      
     |      Returns the type of node that this is.  This is used to differentiate user defined nodes that are derived off different MPx base classes.
     |      
     |      It is not necessary to override this method.
     |      
     |        kDependNode                    Custom node derived from MPxNode

     |      typeId() -> MTypeId
     |      
     |      Returns the TYPEID of this node.
     |  
     |  typeName(...)

     |  Static methods inherited from OpenMaya.MPxNode:
     |  
     |  addAttribute(...)
     |      addAttribute(attr) -> None
     |      
     |      This method adds a new attribute to a user defined node type during the type's initialization.
     |      
     |      This method will only work during the static initialization method of the user defined node class.  The initialization method is the one that is passed into  MFnPlugin.registerNode(). The attributes must first be created using one of the MFnAttribute classes, and can then be added using this method.
     |      
     |      For compound attributes, the proper way to use this method is by calling it with the parent attribute. If a compound attribute is passed, this method will add all of its children.
     |      NOTE: A failure will occur if you attempt to call addAttribute() on the children of a compound attribute.
     |      
     |      * attr (MObject) - new attribute to add.
     |  
     |  attributeAffects(...)
     |      attributeAffects(whenChanges, isAffected) -> None
     |      
     |      This method specifies that a particular input attribute affects a specific output attribute.  This is required to make evaluation efficient.  When an input changes, only the affected outputs will be computed. Output attributes cannot be keyable - if they are keyable, this method will fail.
     |      
     |      This method must be called for every attribute dependency when initializing the node's attributes.  The attributes must first be added using the MPxNode.addAttribute() method.  Failing to call this method will cause the node not to update when its inputs change. If there are no calls to this method in a node's initialization, then the compute method will never be called.
     |      
     |      This method will only work during the static initialization method of the user defined node class.  The initialization method is the one that is passed into MFnPlugin.registerNode().  As a result, it does not work with dynamic attributes. For an alternate solution which handles dynamic as well as non-dynamic attributes refer to MPxNode.setDependentsDirty.()
     |      
     |      * whenChanges (MObject) - input attribute - MObject that points to an input attribute that has already been added.
     |      * isAffected (MObject) - affected output attribute - MObject that points to an output attribute that has already been added.
     |  
     |  inheritAttributesFrom(...)
     |      inheritAttributesFrom(parentClassName) -> None
     |      
     |      This method allows a class of plugin node to inherit all of the attributes of a second class of plugin node.
     |      
     |      This method will only work during the static initialization method of the user defined node class and must be called before any other attributes have been added.  The initialization method is the one that is passed into  MFnPlugin.registerNode().
     |      
     |      A plugin node may only inherit attributes from one other class of plugin node. Attempting to call this method multiple times within a node's initialization method will result in an error.
     |      
     |      Both node classes must be registered using the same MPxNode type, listed in MPxNode.type().
     |      
     |      * parentClassName (string) - class of node to inherit attributes from.

     |  Method resolution order:
     |      MPxHwShaderNode
     |      OpenMaya.MPxNode
     |      __builtin__.object
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(...)
     |      x.__init__(...) initializes x; see help(type(x)) for signature
     |  
     |  bind(...)
     |      bind(request, view) -> self
     |      
     |      This method is invoked for hardware rendering to Maya's 3D view.
     |      
     |      This is the preferred method of interactive feedback and performance. the "gl" version should be used for batch hardware rendering.
     |      
     |      This method is called to set up the OpenGL state.  It would typically ensure that textures were bound and that any specific OpenGL extensions are enabled.  A status code of MS::kSuccess should be returned unless there was a problem during the display, such as insufficient memory or required input data is missing or invalid.
     |      
     |      * request (MDrawRequest) - the draw request.
     |      * view (M3dView) - the view in which to draw.
     |  
     |  colorsPerVertex(...)
     |      colorsPerVertex() -> int
     |      
     |      This method returns the number of color values per vertex that the hw shader node would like to receive from Maya.  Maya will attempt to provide all the color data that the shader would like but it will never provide more data that is actually available in the shape.  The color sets returned by getColorSetNames() will override the number of color sets specified by colorsPerVertex(). If you do not override this method or getColorSetNames(), Maya will provide no colors per vertex.
     |      
     |      Returns the number of color values desired
     |  
     |  currentPath(...)
     |      currentPath() -> MDagPath
     |      
     |      This method returns a reference to the current path that the shader is invoked for.
     |      
     |      The path is only valid before a call to any of the attribute specifying routines:
     |      
     |         normalsPerVertex()
     |         colorsPerVertex()
     |         getColorSetNames()
     |         texCoordsPerVertex()
     |         getTexCoordSetNames()
     |         hasTransparency()
     |         provideVertexIDs()
     |      
     |      The path is not guaranteed to be valid at any other time.
     |      
     |      This method allows the plugin to return attribute queries which are relative to a specific path or object.
     |      
     |      For example, the plugin can retrieve the MObject from the path, then use the MFnMesh class on the MObject, assuming the object is a polygonal surface. Through MFnMesh the code can query the actual number of texture coordinate sets on the surface and return appropriate values for the getTexCoordSetNames() routine.
     |      
     |      The [gl]bind(), [gl]unbind() and [gl]geometry() routines already have access to a dag path which is the same path as the one which can be retrieved via this method.
     |      
     |      For performance reasons, it is recommended that for those methods the MDagPath passed in as an argument should be used.
     |      
     |      Returns an MDagPath. Note that this path can be invalid
     |      Use MDagPath.isValid() to confirm the validity of the path.
     |  
     |  currentShadingEngine(...)
     |      currentShadingEngine() -> MObject
     |      
     |      This method returns an MObject to the shading engine that is currently being rendered. This method will only return a valid MObject during the following calls:
     |      
     |        normalsPerVertex()
     |        colorsPerVertex()
     |        getColorSetNames()
     |        texCoordsPerVertex()
     |        getTexCoordSetNames()
     |        hasTransparency()
     |        provideVertexIDs()
     |        getAvailableImages()
     |        bind(), glBind()
     |        geometry(), glGeometry()
     |        unbind(), glUnbind()
     |  
     |  dirtyMask(...)
     |      dirtyMask() -> int
     |      
     |      This method returns a "dirty" mask that indicates which geometry items have changed from the last invocation of the plugin to draw. The mask is valid at the time that geometry() or glGeometry() is called and at no other time.
     |      
     |      Note that this mask is relative to the geometry for the current object (path) being drawn by the shader. The current path is the MDagPath argument passed in via the geometry routines.
     |      
     |      In general the mask will mark the geometry as not being dirty.
     |      
     |      Scenarios where the geometry will be marked dirty include:
     |      
     |        Whenever a geometry attribute changes. For example positions or normals are modified.
     |        Whenever the attributes being requested changes from the previous invocation of the shader. For example, if in the previous invocation the plugin asks for position only, and in the current invocation asks for position and normals, then the geometry attributes returned will have changed and thus be marked "dirty".
     |      
     |      Returns the dirty mask which can be bit 'AND'ed against the values:
     |        kDirtyNone
     |        kDirtyVertexArray
     |        kDirtyNormalArray
     |        kDirtyColorArrays
     |        kDirtyTexCoordArrays
     |        kDirtyAll
     |  
     |  geometry(...)
     |      geometry(request, view, prim, writable, indexCount, indexArray, vertexCount, vertexIDs, vertexArray, normalCount, normalArrays, colorCount, colorArrays, texCoordCount, texCoordArrays) -> self
     |      
     |      This method is invoked for hardware rendering to Maya's 3D view.
     |      
     |      This is the preferred method of interactive feedback and performance. the "gl" version should be used for batch hardware rendering.
     |      
     |      This method does all the actual OpenGL drawing.  The arguments contain all the data to successfully call glDrawElements or glDrawRangeElements.  It is possible that there will be multiple calls to this method surrounded by a single call to bind() and unbind().
     |      
     |      Note 1.
     |      The array of vertex IDs returned corresponds to each triangle's vertex. This allows access to associated blind data per vertex. The vertexIDs array allows querying of information such as color per vertex etc.
     |      
     |      Note 2.
     |      The arrays passed to this method can contain sparse information.  Check array positions against None to ensure that the array information item is valid.
     |      
     |      It is necessary to use the indexArray to access information contained in the data arrays.
     |      
     |      * request (MDrawRequest) - the draw request.
     |      * view (M3dView) - the view in which to draw.
     |      * prim (int) - the type of primitive to draw.  This is one of the values accepted by glBegin().  Typically it will be GL_TRIANGLES but it could be any of the others.
     |      * writable (int) this is a mask which indicates which of the various array arguments can be modified in place.  If a bit in writable is set then you can modify corresponding data array (after casting it to a non-const type).  If the bit is not set in writable then you must not> modify the data since it points to internal Maya storage.  You can test the bits in writeable against the values
     |      :  kWriteNone
     |        kWriteVertexArray
     |        kWriteNormalArray
     |        kWriteColorArrays
     |        kWriteTexCoordArrays
     |        kWriteAll
     |      * indexCount (int) - specifies both the number of indices to draw and the size of the indexArray argument.
     |      * indexArray (buffer of int values) - the array of index values.  This array is in a format suitable for passing as the indices argument to glDrawElements() or glDrawRangeElements().  See the OpenGL documentation for details on calling these routines.
     |      * vertexCount (int) - the number of elements in the vertexArray, the normalArray, each of the colorArrays, and each of the texCoordArrays.
     |      * vertexIDs (buffer - int values) - the component IDs of the vertices in vertexArray. This array is only provided if it was requested by overriding the provideVertexIDs() method to return True.
     |      * vertexArray (buffer - float values) - the array of vertex data.  Currently, this is always 3 element floating point values.  This data is in a format suitable for passing to glVertexPointer().  See the OpenGL documentation for details.
     |      * normalCount (int) - the number of individual "normal" arrays that are being provided in normalArrays.  See the description of normalsPerVertex method below for details.
     |      * normalArrays (array of buffer - float values) - the normal (and tangent) data suitable. There may be 0, 1, 2, or 3 "normal" arrays.  See the description of the normalsPerVertex method below for details.
     |      * colorCount (int) - the number of individual color arrays.
     |      * colorArrays (array of buffer - float values) - the arrays of color data.  The first set of color data is pointed to by colorArrays[0].  Each color array contains vertexCount color values, each of which is 4 floating point values long and represents the red, green, blue, and alph values on a 0 to 1 scale.  Each individual array is suitable for passing to glColorPointer().
     |      * texCoordCount (int) - the number of texture coordinate arrays. Each array contains one set of UV texture coordinates.
     |      * texCoordArrays (array of buffer - float values) - the arrays of texture coordinate data. The first set of texture coordinate data is pointed to by texCoordArrays[0].  Each array contains vertexCount coordinate values, each of which is 2 floating point values long.  Each individual array is suitable for passing to glTexCoordPointer().
     |  
     |  getAvailableImages(...)
     |      getAvailableImages(uvSetName) -> list of strings/None
     |      
     |      Maya will call this method to get your shader's list of images which are available for use in the UV texture editor for the UV set specified. Typically, this list will include one entry for each texture using the specified UV set, however, your shader is free to return as many images as you wish (for example, blending between two textures, texture alpha masks, artificially shaded views of bump/normal maps, etc). Your shader's renderImage() method will be used to render the images themselves.
     |      
     |      * uvSetName (string) - Name of a UV set the channel list should be filtered against.
     |      
     |      Returns the names of the images this shader defines which are valid for the uvSetName specified.
     |      Returns None if method is not implemented : Use the default behaviour.
     |  
     |  getColorSetNames(...)
     |      getColorSetNames(names) -> int
     |      
     |      This method returns an array of color per vertex set names. Maya will attempt to provide color per vertex data from these maps in the corresponding array element in the colorArrays argument to the geometry method.  For example, if the names[2] is "cpv56" then colorArrays[2] will be the array of values from cpv56, or None if the shape being rendered does not have a color set of that name. Ifthis method is not overridden an empty list of names will be returned,and Maya will use colorsPerVertex() to determine how many color setsto provide.
     |      
     |      * names [IN/OUT] (list of string) - a string array holding the names of the color per vertex sets from which color data should be extracted.
     |      
     |      Returns the number of elements in the names array.
     |  
     |  getTexCoordSetNames(...)
     |      getTexCoordSetNames(names) -> int
     |      
     |      This method returns an array of texture coordinate set names. Maya will attempt to provide texture coordinates from these maps in the corresponding array element in the texCoordArrays argument to the geometry method.  For example, if the names[2] is "uvSet3" then texCoordArrays[2] will be the array of values from uvSet3. If this method is not overridden an empty list of names will be returned, and Maya will use texCoordsPerVertex() to determine how many uv sets to provide.
     |      
     |      * names [IN/OUT] (list of string) - a string array holding the names of the uvSets from which texture coordinate data should be extracted.
     |      
     |      Returns the number of elements in the names array.
     |  
     |  glBind(...)
     |      glBind(shapePath) -> self
     |      
     |      This method should only be overridden for hardware rendering.
     |      
     |      The implementation can assume the graphics context and model view projection matrix have already been set.
     |      
     |      This method will be invoked once per frame and should be overridden to allocate any resources needed for the draw. For example, binding vertex programs, fragment programs, or allocating textures. A status code of MS::kSuccess should be returned unless there was a problem such as insufficient memory or required input data is missing or        invalid.
     |      
     |      * shapePath (MDagPath) - Path to the surface being drawn.
     |  
     |  glGeometry(...)
     |      glGeometry(shapePath, prim, writable, indexCount, indexArray, vertexCount, vertexIDs, vertexArray, normalCount, normalArrays, colorCount, colorArrays, texCoordCount, texCoordArrays) -> self
     |      
     |      This method should only be overridden for hardware rendering.
     |      
     |      The implementation can assume graphics context and model view projection matrix have already been set.
     |      
     |      This method does all the actual OpenGL drawing.  The arguments contain all the data to successfully call glDrawElements or glDrawRangeElements.  It is possible that there will be multiple calls to this method surrounded by a single call to bind() and unbind().

     |      
     |      It is necessary to use the indexArray to access information contained in the data arrays.
     |      
     |      * shapePath (MDagPath) - Path to the surface being drawn.
     |      See geometry() description for detail on the other parameters.
     |  
     |  glUnbind(...)
     |      glUnbind(shapePath) -> self
     |      
     |      This method should only be overridden for hardware rendering.
     |      
     |      The implementation can assume the graphics context and model view projection matrix have already been set.
     |      
     |      This method will be invoked once per frame and should be overridden to deallocate any resources used to draw. It's important that all resources be released when a batch hardware render has occured because the graphics context will be deleted. It may be desireable to override the other version of bind/unbind to keep track of whether the draw is for the 3D view or the batch hardware renderer. This information could then be used to better track the reuse of resources and optimize performance.
     |      
     |      A status code of MS::kSuccess should be returned unless there was a problem.
     |      
     |      * shapePath (MDagPath) - Path to the surface being drawn.
     |  
     |  hasTransparency(...)
     |      hasTransparency() -> bool
     |      
     |      This method returns a boolean value that indicates whether the object will be drawn transparently or not.  Transparent objects must be drawn after all the opaque objects in the scene or they will not display correctly.  Maya uses the return value to determine when it can draw this shape.
     |      
     |      Note : The functionality in this method has been subsumed by the transparencyOptions() method. It is recommended that shader node writers use this newer method as it provides greater control over how transparency is interpreted by Maya's refresh mechanism.
     |      
     |      For backward compatibility, if this method is specified and returns True, it will override the transparencyOptions() method.
     |      
     |      Returns True if the object will be transparent or False if it will not.
     |  
     |  invertTexCoords(...)
     |      invertTexCoords() -> bool
     |      
     |      Specifies whether this shader requires inverted texture coordinates. (i.e. where the top-left hand corner of UV space is (0,0) instead of the bottom-left corner).
     |      
     |      By default, this method will return False to ensure compatibility with existing shader code.
     |  
     |  normalsPerVertex(...)
     |      normalsPerVertex() -> int
     |      
     |      Specifies how many normals per vertex the HW shader would like Maya to provide.  This can range from 0 to 3.  The first normal is the surface normal.  The second "normal" is the primary tangent (generally the "u" direction).  The third "normal" is the secondary tangent or the binormal (generally the "v" direction). Together, the normal, tangent and binormal form an orthogonal basis frequently named "tangent space basis".
     |      
     |      The tangent and binormal vectors are guaranteed to be normalized and orthogonal to the surface normal. Please note that extracting the tangent and/or binormal requires expensive calculations, that will slow down refresh time substantially. In a future version, Maya may cache the resulting tangent space basis; in the meantime, only ask for more than one normal per vertex if they are absolutely required.
     |      
     |      Also note that the tangent and binormal calculation requires a uv map. Currently, they are always computed from the first available uv map; if there is no uv mapping on the surface, Maya will only provide surface normals in the geometry call, regardless of the value returned by normalsPerVertex().
     |      
     |      If you do not override this method, Maya will provide 1 normal per vertex.
     |      
     |      Maya will automatically and silently clamp the result of this function to the [0,3] range.
     |      
     |      COMPATIBILITY NOTE: Automatic tangent space basis calculation is only supported starting with Maya 4.0.1. Maya 4.0 supported a different scheme that was much more complicated and no longer supported.
     |      
     |      Returns the number of normal values desired. (0 = none, 1 = surface normal only, 2 = surface normal + tangent, 3 = surface normal + tangent + binormal)
     |  
     |  provideVertexIDs(...)
     |      provideVertexIDs() -> bool
     |      
     |      This method returns a boolean value that indicates whether a map of the vertex IDs will be provided to the geometry method.
     |      
     |      Returns True if vertex IDs should be provided to the geometry method.
     |  
     |  renderImage(...)
     |      renderImage(imageName, region, parameters) -> [int, int]/None
     |      renderImage(uiDrawManager, imageName, region, parameters) -> [int, int]/None
     |      
     |      This method allows you to to render the background image used for this shader in the UV texture editor. The image requested will be one of the image names returned by your shader's getAvailableImages() method.
     |      
     |      The implementation must return the dimensions of the image in the 'imageWidth' and 'imageHeight' parameters so that Maya can perform pixel snapping and other resolution-dependent operations.
     |      
     |      The implementation can assume OpenGL context, model view projection matrix, and texture transformations have already been set. A default color of white will be set, however you are free to change this. The magnification filter will be set to either point or bilinear based on user configuration and should not be modified. The values of GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S and GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T are undefined on entry, and your implementation is responsible for setting them to appropriate values (e.g. GL_REPEAT).
     |      
     |      The arguments contain the name of the image to render, and the vertex and texture coordinate values to use at each corner of the rectangular image being rendered. Your implementation is responsible for restoring the original the value of any OpenGL state that is modified.
     |      
     |      * imageName (string) - Name of the image to render. This corresponds to one of the image names returned by your shader's getAvailableImages() method.
     |      * region (float[2][2]) - Rectangular region to be rendered. The values of this parameter should be used to populate the vertex and texture coordinates of the rectangle being rendered.
     |      * parameters (RenderParamters) - Additional parameters on how to render the image. The values reflect the image settings of the UV editor.
     |      
     |      A second version with the uiDrawManager parameter allows you to to render the background image used for this shader in the UV texture editor in viewport 2.0.
     |      
     |      * uiDrawManager (MUIDrawManager) - The UI draw manager, it can be used to draw some simple geometry
     |      
     |      Returns None if method is not implemented : No rendering will occur.
     |  
     |  renderSwatchImage(...)
     |      renderSwatchImage(image) -> self/None
     |      
     |      If the shader specifies to override swatch rendering, then this method must be overridden in order to draw anything into a swatch.
     |      
     |      The shader will only draw a swatch if it has been registered to do so, by providing a valid classification during MFnPlugin::registerNode(). The shader should provide a classification that defines a swatch rendering node such as : "shader/surface/utility/:drawdb/shader/surface/myCustomShader:swatch/myCustomShaderSwatchGenerator" and have "myCustomShaderSwatchGenerator" registered has a swatch renderer : MSwatchRenderRegister.registerSwatchRender("myCustomShaderSwatchGenerator", MHWShaderSwatchGenerator.createObj );
     |      
     |      The default implementation is to draw nothing. The basic logic to draw a swatch is as follows:
     |      
     |        Determine the size of the swatch required. This is the dimensions of the MImage passed in as an argument. The pixels for the MImage will have been pre-allocated. The format of the pixels is 32-bit R,G,B,A, with 8-bits per channel.
     |        Either use an offscreen "swatch context" provided to you or use your own offscreen context. The provided context is available via the MHardwareRenderer class method makeSwatchContextCurrent(). Note that the swatch context may be smaller than the desired image size. In this case the rendering dimensions will be clamped.
     |        Either use swatch geometry provided to you, or use your own swatch geometry. The provided geometry is available via the method MHardwareRenderer::referenceDefaultGeometry(). The possible "default" geometries are either a sphere, cube or plane.
     |        Either use the provided "default" light and "default" camera or set up your own. Use the methods (getSwatchOrthoCameraSetting(), getSwatchLightDirection()) on MHardwareRenderer to get these defaults.
     |        Read back the swatch context into the provided MImage. The convenience method MHardwareRenderer::readSwatchContextPixels() can be used. By default the format of the MImage and the swatch context are the same, so the user does not need to worry about this. The context will read into the pre-allocated MImage pixels.
     |        Unreference any swatch geometry used for rendering using MHardwareRenderer::dereferenceGeometry().
     |      
     |      * image [IN/OUT] (MImage) - Image object to which this method must write the rendered swatch. On input the image's dimensions are already set and pixel storage already allocated.
     |      
     |      Returns None if method is not implemented : No rendering will occur.
     |  
     |  supportsBatching(...)
     |      supportsBatching() -> bool
     |      
     |      Specifies whether or not this shader supports batched rendering of shapes.
     |      
     |      In normal rendering, a shader is invoked using bind/geometry/unbind (or glBind/glGeometry/glUnbind) once for each shape being rendered. When a shader is used in batched rendering mode however, bind is called once, a series of geometry calls are made for each shape being rendered, followed by a single call to unbind (and similarly for glBind, glGeometry and glUnbind). As shader binding/unbinding can be expensive, batched rendering can significantly improve rendering performance. The more (particularly expensive) operations that can be moved out of the geometry/glGeometry methods the greater the performance improvement is. Ideally, only shape specific operations (such as binding geometry arrays and shape matrices) should be left in the geometry methods.
     |      
     |      It is important to note that your shader can only use batched rendering mode if there is no shape (i.e. dag path) specific code in bind, glBind, unbind, or glUnbind. If any of these methods perform shape specific processing, this code must either be moved into geometry/glGeometry, or you must return False in this method to indicate batching should be disabled for this shader.
     |      
     |      By default, this method will return False to ensure compatibility with existing shader code.
     |  
     |  texCoordsPerVertex(...)
     |      texCoordsPerVertex() -> int
     |      
     |      This method returns the number of texture coordinate values per vertex that the hw shader node would like to receive from Maya. Maya will attempt to provide all the texture coordinate data that the shader would like but it will never provide more data than is actually available in the shape.  The uv sets returned by getTexCoordSetNames() will override the number of uv sets specified by texCoordsPerVertex(). If you do not override this method or getTexCoordSetNames(), Maya will provide no texture coordinates per vertex.
     |      
     |      Note: Currently, Maya only retains 2 dimensional texture coordinate data but this may change in a future release.
     |      
     |      Returns the number of texture coordinate values desired
     |  
     |  transparencyOptions(...)
     |      transparencyOptions() -> int
     |      
     |      This method returns transparency options for usage as hints for Maya's internal draw during a given rendering pass. Parameters are returned via an integer containing masked out bits. By default the mask is set to 0, meaning that the drawing should be treated as regular opaque object drawing. This will generally mean one call per draw pass.
     |      
     |      Options to control transparency are specified by returning one or more masks specified by the values
     |      :
     |      
     |        kIsTransparent : Draw as a transparent object. If no transparency overrides are specified, then control of how to draw during a given pass is determined internally by Maya's refresh algorithm, and options the user can set per modelling viewport.
     |        kNoTransparencyFrontBackCull : When kisTransparent is set and this flag is set, do not perform transparency drawing using the internal 2-pass front-face + back-face culling algorithm.
     |        kNoTransparencyPolygonSort : When kisTransparent is set and this flag is set, do not perform transparency drawing using the internal 2-pass drawing of back-to-front sorted triangles.
     |      
     |      Note : Setting the "hasTransparency()" method to True will override this method. This is for backward compatibility with behaviour on existing hardware shader nodes. It is recommended that shaders use the "transparencyOptions()" override, and not longer use the older "hasTransparency()" override from their shader classes.
     |      
     |      Retuns an integer containing the appropriate options set via masks.
     |  
     |  unbind(...)
     |      unbind(request, view) -> self
     |      
     |      This method is invoked for hardware rendering to Maya's 3D view.
     |      
     |      This is the preferred method of interactive feedback and performance. the "gl" version should be used for batch hardware rendering.
     |      
     |      This method is called to restore the OpenGL state.  Specifically, it must disable any OpenGL extensions that the matching bind() method may have enabled.  This is necessary to ensure that the rest of Maya's drawing code continues to work correctly.  A status code of MS::kSuccess should be returned unless there was a problem such as insufficient memory or required input data is missing or invalid.
     |      
     |      The arguments passed to this method are the same ones that were passed to the bind() method.
     |      
     |      * request (MDrawRequest) - the draw request.
     |      * view (M3dView) - the view in which to draw.

     |  Methods inherited from OpenMaya.MPxNode:
     |  
     |  addExternalContentForFileAttr(...)
     |      addExternalContentForFileAttr(table, attr) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is a helper for derived clases implementing getExternalContent().  It augments the external content info table passed in with an entry describing external content whose location is described by the specified attribute.
     |      
     |      The method will not overwrite existing items, i.e. items with the same key. (attribute name).  In this context, overwriting an item means the caller has called this function twice with the same attribute, or that two separate but identically named attributes were used.  If replacing an entry is the desired effect, it is the caller's responsibility to erase the previous item first.
     |      
     |      * table [OUT] (MExternalContentInfoTable) - table The table in which the new entry will be added.
     |      * attr (MObject) - The attribute for which the plug value will be queried for a location.
     |      
     |      Returns True if an item was sucessfully added to the table.  False if the attribute does not describe a non-empty location, or an item with the same key was already present in the table.
     |  
     |  compute(...)
     |      compute(plug, dataBlock) -> self
     |      
     |      This method should be overridden in user defined nodes.
     |      
     |      Recompute the given output based on the nodes inputs.  The plug represents the data value that needs to be recomputed, and the data block holds the storage for all of the node's attributes.
     |      
     |      The MDataBlock will provide smart handles for reading and writing this node's attribute values.  Only these values should be used when performing computations.
     |      
     |      When evaluating the dependency graph, Maya will first call the compute method for this node.  If the plug that is provided to the compute indicates that that the attribute was defined by the Maya parent node, the compute method should return None.  When this occurs, Maya will call the internal Maya node from which the user-defined node is derived to compute the plug's value. Returning any othervalue (including self) will tell Maya that this node successfully computed theplug. Raising an exception will tell Maya that this node failed at computingthe plug. Note that in most cases, Maya ignores node compute failures.
     |      
     |      In other words, the compute method should return None to get the Maya parent class to compute the plug. It should return self (or any other value) to indicate that the plug was computed successfully.
     |      
     |      This means that a user defined node does not need to be concerned with computing inherited output attributes.  However, if desired, these can be safely recomputed by this method to change the behaviour of the node.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug representing the attribute that needs to be recomputed.
     |      * block (MDataBlock) - data block containing storage for the node's attributes.
     |  
     |  connectionBroken(...)
     |      connectionBroken( plug, otherPlug, asSrc) -> self
     |      
     |      This method gets called when connections are broken with attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (bool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  connectionMade(...)
     |      connectionMade(plug, otherPlug, asSrc) -> self
     |      
     |      This method gets called when connections are made to attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (bool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  copyInternalData(...)
     |      copyInternalData(node) -> self
     |      
     |      This method is overriden by nodes that store attribute data in some internal format.
     |      
     |      On duplication this method is called on the duplicated node with the node being duplicated passed as the parameter.  Overriding this method gives your node a chance to duplicate any internal data you've been storing and manipulating outside of normal attribute data.
     |      
     |      * node (MPxNode) - the node that is being duplicated.
     |  
     |  dependsOn(...)
     |      dependsOn( plug, otherPlug) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method may be overridden by the user defined node. It should only be required to override this on rare occasions.
     |      
     |      This method determines whether a specific attribute depends on another attribute.
     |      
     |      You should return None to specify that Maya should determines the dependency (default).
     |      
     |      This is mainly to define dependency of dynamic attributes, since attributeAffects does not work with dynamic attributes.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |  
     |  doNotWrite(...)
     |      doNotWrite() -> bool
     |      
     |      use this method to query the "do not write" state of this proxy node. True is returned if this node will not be saved when the maya model is written out.
     |  
     |  forceCache(...)
     |      forceCache(ctx=MDGContext::current()) -> MDataBlock
     |      
     |      Get the datablock for this node. If there is no datablock then one will be created.
     |      NOTE: This should be used only in places where fast access to the datablock outside of a compute is critical such as the transformUsing method of MPxSurfaceShape.
     |      
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - The context in which the datablock will be retrieved.
     |  
     |  getExternalContent(...)
     |      getExternalContent(table) -> self
     |      
     |      The table populated by this method must include the location of all the content (files) used by this node, including those that do not exist.  See MExternalContentInfoTable for details.
     |      
     |      Keys used to add items to this table will be the same that get passed to setExternalContent through its MExternalContentLocationTable parameter to perform a batched change of content location.
     |      
     |      When implementing getExternalContent, you are responsible for forwarding the call to the base class when it makes sense to do so, so that base classes  can also add their external content to the table.
     |      
     |      The default implementation does nothing.
     |      
     |      * table [OUT] (MExternalContentInfoTable) - Content information table that this method must populate.
     |  
     |  getFilesToArchive(...)
     |      getFilesToArchive(shortName=False, unresolvedName=False, markCouldBeImageSequence=False) -> list of strings
     |      
     |      Use this method to return all external files used by this node. This file list will be used by the File > Archive zip feature, maya.exe -archive and the `file -q -list` mel command.
     |      
     |      Only include files that exist.
     |      
     |      If shortName is True, return just the filename portion of the path. Otherwise, return a full path.
     |      
     |      If unresolvedName is True, return the path before any resolution has been done (i.e leave it as a relative path, include unexpanded environment variables,  tildes, ".."s etc). Otherwise, resolve the file     path and return an absolute path (to resolve with standard Maya path resolution, use MFileObject.resolvedFullName()).
     |      
     |      * shortName (bool) - If True, only add the filename of the path.
     |      * unresolvedName (bool) - If True, add paths before any resolution, rather than absolute paths.
     |      * markCouldBeImageSequence (bool) - If True, append an asterisk after any file path that could be an image sequence (note: only used by maya.exe -archive).
     |  
     |  getInternalValue(...)
     |      getInternalValue(plug, dataHandle) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is overridden by nodes that store attribute data in some internal format.
     |      
     |      The internal state of attributes can be set or queried using the setInternal and internal methods of MFnAttribute.
     |      
     |      When internal attribute values are queried via getAttr or MPlug.getValue() this method is called.
     |      
     |      All internal data should respect the current context, which may be obtained from MDGContext::current()
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being queried.
     |      * dataHandle [OUT] (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle to store the attribute value.
     |  
     |  getInternalValueInContext(...)
     |      getInternalValueInContext(plug, dataHandle, ctx) -> bool [OBSOLETE]
     |      
     |      This method is obsolete. Override MPxNode.getInternalValue instead.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being queried.
     |      * dataHandle [OUT] (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle to store the attribute value.
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - the context the method is being evaluated in.
     |  
     |  internalArrayCount(...)
     |      internalArrayCount(plug) -> int
     |      internalArrayCount(plug, ctx) -> int  [OBSOLETE]
     |      
     |      This method is overridden by nodes that have internal array attributes which are not stored in Maya's datablock. This method is used by Maya to determine the non-sparse count of array elements during file IO. If the internal array is stored sparsely, you should return the maximum index of the array plus one. If the internal array is non-sparse then return the length of the array.
     |      
     |      This method does not need to be implemented for attributes that are stored in the datablock since Maya will use the datablock size.
     |      
     |      If this method is overridden, it should return -1 for attributes which it does not handle. Maya will use the datablock size to determine the array length when -1 is returned.
     |      
     |      All internal data should respect the current context, which may be obtained from MDGContext.current()
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the array plug.
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - the context, default to MDGContext.current().
     |  
     |  isAbstractClass(...)
     |      isAbstractClass() -> bool
     |      
     |      Override this class to return True if this node is an abstract node. An abstract node can only be used as a base class.  It cannot be created using the 'createNode' command.
     |      
     |      It is not necessary to override this method.
     |  
     |  isPassiveOutput(...)
     |      isPassiveOutput(plug) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method may be overridden by the user defined node if it wants to provide output attributes which do not prevent value modifications to the destination attribute. For example, output plugs on animation curve nodes are passive. This allows the attributes driven by the animation curves to be set to new values by the user.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug representing output in question.
     |  
     |  legalConnection(...)
     |      legalConnection(plug, otherPlug, asSrc) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method allows you to check for legal connections being made to attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      You should return None to specify that maya should handle this connection if you are unable to determine if it is legal.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (bool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  legalDisconnection(...)
     |      legalDisconnection(plug, otherPlug, arsSrc) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method allows you to check for legal disconnections being made to attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      You should return None to specify that maya should handle this disconnection if you are unable to determine if it is legal.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (boool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  name(...)
     |      name() -> string
     |      
     |      Returns the name of this particular instance of this class.  Each objectin the dependency graph has a name.  This name will be used by the UIand by MEL.
     |      
     |      It is not necessary to override this method.
     |      
     |      Returns the name of the node
     |  
     |  passThroughToMany(...)
     |      passThroughToMany(plug, plugArray) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is overriden by nodes that want to control the traversal behavior of some Maya search algorithms which traverse the history/future of shape nodes looking for directly related nodes. In particular, the Artisan paint code uses this method when searching for paintable nodes, and the disk cache code uses this method when searching for upstream cacheFile nodes.
     |      
     |      If this method is not implemented or returns False, the base class Maya implementation of this method calls passThroughToOne and returns the results of that call.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the plug.
     |      * plugArray (MPlugArray) - the corresponding plugs.
     |  
     |  passThroughToOne(...)
     |      passThroughToOne(plug) -> plug
     |      
     |      This method may be overriden by nodes that have a one-to-one relationship between an input attribute and a corresponding output attribute. This method is used by Maya to perform the following capabilities:
     |      
     |      - When this node is deleted, the delete command will rewire the source of the input attribute to the destination of the output attribute if the source and destination are connected to nodes that are not deleted.
     |      - History traversal algorithms such as the bakePartialHistory command use this method to direct its traversal through a shape's construction history.
     |      - The base class Maya implementation of passThroughToAll will call this method if passThroughToAll returns False.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the plug.
     |  
     |  postConstructor(...)
     |      postConstructor() -> self
     |      
     |      Internally maya creates two objects when a user defined node is created, the internal MObject and the user derived object.
     |      The association between the these two objects is not made until after the MPxNode constructor is called. This implies that no MPxNode member function can be called from the MPxNode constructor.
     |      The postConstructor will get called immediately after the constructor when it is safe to call any MPxNode member function.
     |  
     |  postEvaluation(...)
     |      postEvaluation(context, evalNode, evalType) -> None
     |      
     |      Clean up node's internal state after threaded evaluation.
     |      
     |      After the evaluation graph execution, each node gets a chance to restore / update its internal states.For example, resetting draw state.
     |      
     |      This code has to be thread safe, non - blocking and work only on data owned by the node.
     |      
     |      This call will most likely happen from a worker thread.
     |      
     |      * context (MDGContext) - Context in which the evaluation is happening.
     |                               This should be respected and only internal state
     |                               information pertaining to it should be modified.
     |      * evaluationNode (MEvaluationNode) - Evaluation node which contains
     |                                           information about the dirty plugs the
     |                                           dirty plugs that were evaluated for this
     |                                           context.
     |      * evalType (PostEvaluationType)
     |        * kEvaluatedIndirectly : The node's compute function handled evaluation.
     |        * kEvaluatedDirectly   : Evaluation was performed externally and the results injected
     |                                 back into the node.  This would happen in situations such as
     |                                 extracting values from an external cache.The node needs to
     |                                 update any additional internal state based on the new values.
     |        * kLeaveDirty          : Evaluation was performed without updating this node. Internal
     |                                 state should be updated to reflect that the node is dirty.
     |  
     |  preEvaluation(...)
     |      preEvaluation(context, evalNode) -> None
     |      
     |      Prepare a node's internal state for threaded evaluation.
     |      
     |      During the evaluation graph execution each node gets a chance to reset its internal states just before being evaluated.
     |      
     |      This code has to be thread safe, non - blocking and work only on data owned by the node.
     |      
     |      The timing of this callback is at the discretion of evaluation graph dependencies and individual evaluators.This means, it should be used purely to prepare this node for evaluation and no particular order should be assumed.
     |      
     |      This call will most likely happen from a worker thread.
     |      
     |      * context (MDGContext) - Context in which the evaluation is happening.
     |                               This should be respected and only internal state
     |                               information pertaining to it should be modified.
     |      * evaluationNode (MEvaluationNode) - Evaluation node which contains
     |                                           information about the dirty plugs that
     |                                           are about to be evaluated for the context.
     |                                           Should be only used to query information.
     |  
     |  setDependentsDirty(...)
     |      setDependentsDirty(plug, plugArray) -> self
     |      
     |      This method can be overridden in user defined nodes to specify which plugs should be set dirty based upon an input plug which Maya is marking dirty. The list of plugs for Maya to mark dirty is returned by the plug array. This method handles both dynamic as well as non-dynamic plugs and is useful in the following ways:
     |      
     |      
     |      
     |      - Allows attributeAffects-style relationships to be handled for dynamically-added attributes. Since MPxNode.attributeAffects() can only be used with non-dynamic attributes, use of this method allows a way for all attributes of a node to affect one another, both dynamic and non-dynamic.
     |      
     |      - Provides more flexible relationships than what is available with MPxNode.attributeAffects(). For example, you may wish to not dirty plugs when the current frame is one. However, as the routine is called during dirty propagation, there are restrictions on what can be done within the routine, most importantly you must not cause any dependency graph computation. For details, see the IMPORTANT NOTE below.
     |      
     |      
     |      
     |      This method is designed to work harmoniously with MPxNode.attributeAffects() on the same node. Alternately, you can do all affects relationships within a yourNode.setDependentsDirty() implementation.
     |      
     |      The body of a user-implemented setDependentsDirty() implementation might look like the following example, which causes the plug called "B" to be set dirty whever plug "A" is changed, i.e. A affects B.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug which is being set dirty by Maya.
     |      * plugArray the programmer should add any plugs which they want to set dirty to this list.
     |  
     |  setDoNotWrite(...)
     |      setDoNotWrite(bool) -> self
     |      
     |      Use this method to mark the "do not write" state of this proxy node.  If set, this node will not be saved when the Maya model is written out. 
     |      
     |      NOTES:
     |      1. Plug-in "requires" information will be written out with the model when saved.  But a subsequent reload and resave of the file will cause these to go away.
     |      2. If this node is a DAG and has a parent or children, the "do not write" flag of the parent or children will not be set. It is the developer's responsibility to ensure that the resulting scene file is capable of being read in without errors due to unwritten nodes.
     |  
     |  setExternalContent(...)
     |      setExternalContent(table) -> self
     |      
     |      This is useful in the context of content relocation.  This will be called while the scene is being loaded to apply path changes performed externally. Consequently, interaction with the rest of the scene must be kept to a minimum.  It is however valid to call this method outside of scene loading contexts.
     |      
     |      The keys in the map must be the same as the ones provided by the node in getExternalContent.  The values are the new locations.
     |      
     |      When implementing setExternalContent, you are responsible for forwarding the call to the base class when it makes sense to do so, so that base classes  can also set their external content.
     |      
     |      The default implementation does nothing.
     |      
     |      * table Key->location table with new content locations.
     |  
     |  setExternalContentForFileAttr(...)
     |      setExternalContentForFileAttr(attr, table) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is a helper for derived clases implementing setExternalContent().  It assigns a value to a plug with the one from the table whose key is the same as the passed in attribute name.
     |      
     |      The method will not write to the plug if the attribute is not found in the  table.
     |      
     |      * attr (MObject) - The attribute of the plug we want to write to.
     |      * table (MExternalContentLocationTable) - A table which may hold or not the value for a given plug.
     |      
     |      Returns True if the plug was successfully written to. False if no entry in the table was named after the attribute or if no plug was found.
     |  
     |  setInternalValue(...)
     |      setInternalValue(plug, dataHandle) -> bool
     |      
     |      
     |      This method is overriden by nodes that store attribute data in some internal format.
     |      
     |      The internal state of attributes can be set or queried using the setInternal and internal methods of MFnAttribute.
     |      
     |      When internal attribute values are set via setAttr or MPlug.setValue() this method is called.
     |      
     |      Another use for this method is to impose attribute limits.
     |      
     |      All internal data should respect the current context, which may be obtained from MDGContext::current()
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being set.
     |      * dataHandle (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle containing the value to set.
     |  
     |  setInternalValueInContext(...)
     |      setInternalValueInContext(plug, dataHandle, ctx) -> bool  [OBSOLETE]
     |      
     |      This method is obsolete. Override MPxNode.setInternalValue instead.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being set.
     |      * dataHandle (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle containing the value to set.
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - the context the method is being evaluated in.
     |  
     |  setMPSafe(...)
     |      setMPSafe(bool) -> self
     |      
     |      This method is obsolete. Override MPxNode.setSchedulingType instead.
     |      
     |      Set a flag to specify if a user defined shading node is safe for multi-processor rendering. For a shading node to be MP safe, it cannot access any shared global data and should only use attributes in the datablock to get input data and store output data. 
     |      
     |      NOTE: This should be called from the postConstructor() method for shading node plug-ins only. If a shading node is non-safe, then it will only be useful during single processor rendering.
     |  
     |  shouldSave(...)
     |      shouldSave(plug) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method may be overridden by the user defined node.  It should only be required to override this on rare occasions.
     |      
     |      This method determines whether a specific attribute of this node should be written out during a file save.  The default behavior is to only write the value if it differs from the default and is not being supplied by a connection.  This behavior should be sufficient in most cases.
     |      This method is not called for ramp attributes since they should always be written.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug representing the attribute to be saved.
     |  
     |  thisMObject(...)
     |      thisMObject() -> MObject
     |      
     |      Returns the MObject associated with this user defined node.  This makes it possible to use MFnDependencyNode or to construct plugs to this node's attributes.
     |  
     |  type(...)
     |      type() -> int
     |      
     |      Returns the type of node that this is.  This is used to differentiate user defined nodes that are derived off different MPx base classes.
     |      
     |      It is not necessary to override this method.
     |

     |  
     |  typeId(...)
     |      typeId() -> MTypeId
     |      
     |      Returns the TYPEID of this node.
     |  
     |  typeName(...)
     |      typeName() -> string
     |      
     |      Returns the type name of this node.  The type name identifies the node type to the ASCII file format

     |  Static methods inherited from OpenMaya.MPxNode:
     |  
     |  addAttribute(...)
     |      addAttribute(attr) -> None
     |      
     |      This method adds a new attribute to a user defined node type during the type's initialization.
     |      
     |      This method will only work during the static initialization method of the user defined node class.  The initialization method is the one that is passed into  MFnPlugin.registerNode(). The attributes must first be created using one of the MFnAttribute classes, and can then be added using this method.
     |      
     |      For compound attributes, the proper way to use this method is by calling it with the parent attribute. If a compound attribute is passed, this method will add all of its children.
     |      NOTE: A failure will occur if you attempt to call addAttribute() on the children of a compound attribute.
     |      
     |      * attr (MObject) - new attribute to add.
     |  
     |  attributeAffects(...)
     |      attributeAffects(whenChanges, isAffected) -> None
     |      
     |      This method specifies that a particular input attribute affects a specific output attribute.  This is required to make evaluation efficient.  When an input changes, only the affected outputs will be computed. Output attributes cannot be keyable - if they are keyable, this method will fail.
     |      
     |      This method must be called for every attribute dependency when initializing the node's attributes.  The attributes must first be added using the MPxNode.addAttribute() method.  Failing to call this method will cause the node not to update when its inputs change. If there are no calls to this method in a node's initialization, then the compute method will never be called.
     |      
     |      This method will only work during the static initialization method of the user defined node class.  The initialization method is the one that is passed into MFnPlugin.registerNode().  As a result, it does not work with dynamic attributes. For an alternate solution which handles dynamic as well as non-dynamic attributes refer to MPxNode.setDependentsDirty.()

     |  inheritAttributesFrom(...)
     |      inheritAttributesFrom(parentClassName) -> None
     |      
     |      This method allows a class of plugin node to inherit all of the attributes of a second class of plugin node.
     |      
     |      This method will only work during the static initialization method of the user defined node class and must be called before any other attributes have been added.  The initialization method is the one that is passed into  MFnPlugin.registerNode().
     |      
     |      A plugin node may only inherit attributes from one other class of plugin node. Attempting to call this method multiple times within a node's initialization method will result in an error.
     |      
     |      Both node classes must be registered using the same MPxNode type, listed in MPxNode.type().
     |      
     |      * parentClassName (string) - class of node to inherit attributes from.

     |  
     |  boundingBox(...)
     |      boundingBox() -> MBoundingBox
     |      
     |      This method should be overridden to return a bounding box for the locator.
     |      If this method is overridden, then MPxLocatorNode.isBounded should also be overridden to return True.
     |  
     |  closestPoint(...)
     |      closestPoint(rayPoint, rayDir) -> MPoint
     |      
     |      Returns the point on the locator, in the locator's local space, which is closest along the specified ray.
     |      
     |      By default, the locator's origin (0, 0, 0) is returned.
     |      
     |      This is currently only used by Maya during single selection. See useClosestPointForSelection() for further details on that.
     |      
     |      * rayPoint (MPoint) - The base point defining the ray in space
     |      * rayDir (MVector) - The ray direction in space
     |  
     |  color(...)
     |      color(status) -> int
     |      
     |      This method returns the index of the color that is the default draw color for the given display status.  The index should be used with the methods of M3dView.  The value is not an index into the OpenGL color table. 
     |      
     |      The index that is returned will be into the active, dormant, or template color tables depending on the display status passed in.
     |      
     |      * displayStatus (int) - display status. See M3dView.displayStatus() for a list of valid status.
     |  
     |  colorRGB(...)
     |      colorRGB(status) -> MColor
     |      
     |      This method returns the RGB values of the default draw color for the given display status.
     |      
     |      * displayStatus (int) - display status. See M3dView.displayStatus() for a list of valid status.
     |  
     |  draw(...)
     |      draw(view, path, style, status) -> self
     |      
     |      Overriding this method allows the drawing of custom geometry using standard OpenGL calls.  The OpenGL state should be left in the same state that it was in previously.  The OpenGL routine glPushAttrib may be used to make this easier.
     |      
     |      When this routine is called, the following conditions may be assumed:
     |       - the correct transform matrix will be loaded for the locator, so the geometry should be drawn in local space
     |       - the correct default color will be set for wire frame drawing given the object's state (eg active, dormant, etc.)
     |       - the object is not invisible or hidden
     |       - if the object has a bounding box, then the bounding box is at least partially in the frustum
     |      
     |      
     |      As a convenience, this draw method will also be used by OpenGL's selection mechanism to determine whether this object gets selected by a particular mouse event.  The user does not need to write a separate selection routine.
     |      
     |      * view (M3dView) - 3D view that is being drawn into.
     |      * path (MDagPath) - to the parent (transform node) of this locator in the DAG.
     |      If there is a shape node parented directly beneath the transform node, you can access it 
     |      by calling MDagPath.extendToShape(). 
     |      * style (int) - style to draw object in. See M3dView.displayStyle() for a list of valid styles.
     |      * status (int) - selection status of object. See M3dView.displayStatus() for a list of valid status.
     |  
     |  drawLast(...)
     |      drawLast() -> bool
     |      
     |      Indicates that this locator should be the last item draw in a given refresh cycle.  Objects drawn out-of-order will not preserve the proper transparency sorting.  Conflicts among multiple objects with the drawLast indicator set to TRUE will be resolved by their order in the Outliner, where they will be drawn top-to-bottom.
     |      
     |      The default return value is True.
     |  
     |  excludeAsLocator(...)
     |      excludeAsLocator() -> bool
     |      
     |      When the modelPanel is set to not draw locators, returing True will also not draw the custom locator. If False is returned, the custom locator will also be drawn.
     |      
     |      The default return value is True.
     |  
     |  getShapeSelectionMask(...)
     |      getShapeSelectionMask() -> MSelectionMask
     |      
     |      This routine can be overridden to provide information aboutthe selection mask of the locator. By default the selection maskfor locators is returned.
     |  
     |  isBounded(...)
     |      isBounded() -> bool
     |      
     |      This method should be overridden to return True if the user supplies a bounding box routine.  Supplying a bounding box routine makes refresh and selection more efficient.
     |  
     |  isTransparent(...)
     |      isTransparent() -> bool
     |      
     |      Indicates that this locator uses transparency during ::draw method calls. Objects with transparency must be drawn in a special queue, i.e. after all opaque objects are drawn.
     |      
     |      The default return value is False.
     |  
     |  useClosestPointForSelection(...)
     |      useClosestPointForSelection() -> bool
     |      
     |      Determines whether Maya should call closestPoint() when doing single selection.
     |      
     |      When doing single selection Maya generally chooses the object closest to the selection ray. For locators it first does a hit test by calling the locator's draw method to determine if any part of it lies within the selection box. If the hit test succeeds Maya will add the locator to the list of objects being considered for selection and will use the center of the locator (i.e. its local origin) in determining its distance from the selection ray. This works well for locators which mark a single point in space, with no offset, but may not work as well for more complex locators.
     |      
     |      If this method is overridden to return True, then rather than using the locator's center to determine its distance from the selection ray, Maya will pass the ray to the closestPoint() method and use the point it returns. Note that you will have override closestPoint() as well to provide an appropriate point.

     |  Methods inherited from OpenMaya.MPxNode:
     |  
     |  addExternalContentForFileAttr(...)
     |      addExternalContentForFileAttr(table, attr) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is a helper for derived clases implementing getExternalContent().  It augments the external content info table passed in with an entry describing external content whose location is described by the specified attribute.
     |      
     |      The method will not overwrite existing items, i.e. items with the same key. (attribute name).  In this context, overwriting an item means the caller has called this function twice with the same attribute, or that two separate but identically named attributes were used.  If replacing an entry is the desired effect, it is the caller's responsibility to erase the previous item first.
     |      
     |      * table [OUT] (MExternalContentInfoTable) - table The table in which the new entry will be added.
     |      * attr (MObject) - The attribute for which the plug value will be queried for a location.
     |      
     |      Returns True if an item was sucessfully added to the table.  False if the attribute does not describe a non-empty location, or an item with the same key was already present in the table.
     |  
     |  compute(...)
     |      compute(plug, dataBlock) -> self
     |      
     |      This method should be overridden in user defined nodes.
     |      
     |      Recompute the given output based on the nodes inputs.  The plug represents the data value that needs to be recomputed, and the data block holds the storage for all of the node's attributes.
     |      
     |      The MDataBlock will provide smart handles for reading and writing this node's attribute values.  Only these values should be used when performing computations.
     |      
     |      When evaluating the dependency graph, Maya will first call the compute method for this node.  If the plug that is provided to the compute indicates that that the attribute was defined by the Maya parent node, the compute method should return None.  When this occurs, Maya will call the internal Maya node from which the user-defined node is derived to compute the plug's value. Returning any othervalue (including self) will tell Maya that this node successfully computed theplug. Raising an exception will tell Maya that this node failed at computingthe plug. Note that in most cases, Maya ignores node compute failures.
     |      
     |      In other words, the compute method should return None to get the Maya parent class to compute the plug. It should return self (or any other value) to indicate that the plug was computed successfully.
     |      
     |      This means that a user defined node does not need to be concerned with computing inherited output attributes.  However, if desired, these can be safely recomputed by this method to change the behaviour of the node.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug representing the attribute that needs to be recomputed.
     |      * block (MDataBlock) - data block containing storage for the node's attributes.
     |  
     |  connectionBroken(...)
     |      connectionBroken( plug, otherPlug, asSrc) -> self
     |      
     |      This method gets called when connections are broken with attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (bool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  connectionMade(...)
     |      connectionMade(plug, otherPlug, asSrc) -> self
     |      
     |      This method gets called when connections are made to attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (bool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  copyInternalData(...)
     |      copyInternalData(node) -> self
     |      
     |      This method is overriden by nodes that store attribute data in some internal format.
     |      
     |      On duplication this method is called on the duplicated node with the node being duplicated passed as the parameter.  Overriding this method gives your node a chance to duplicate any internal data you've been storing and manipulating outside of normal attribute data.
     |      
     |      * node (MPxNode) - the node that is being duplicated.
     |  
     |  dependsOn(...)
     |      dependsOn( plug, otherPlug) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method may be overridden by the user defined node. It should only be required to override this on rare occasions.
     |      
     |      This method determines whether a specific attribute depends on another attribute.
     |      
     |      You should return None to specify that Maya should determines the dependency (default).
     |      
     |      This is mainly to define dependency of dynamic attributes, since attributeAffects does not work with dynamic attributes.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |  
     |  doNotWrite(...)
     |      doNotWrite() -> bool
     |      
     |      use this method to query the "do not write" state of this proxy node. True is returned if this node will not be saved when the maya model is written out.
     |  
     |  forceCache(...)
     |      forceCache(ctx=MDGContext::current()) -> MDataBlock
     |      
     |      Get the datablock for this node. If there is no datablock then one will be created.
     |      NOTE: This should be used only in places where fast access to the datablock outside of a compute is critical such as the transformUsing method of MPxSurfaceShape.
     |      
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - The context in which the datablock will be retrieved.
     |  
     |  getExternalContent(...)
     |      getExternalContent(table) -> self
     |      
     |      The table populated by this method must include the location of all the content (files) used by this node, including those that do not exist.  See MExternalContentInfoTable for details.
     |      
     |      Keys used to add items to this table will be the same that get passed to setExternalContent through its MExternalContentLocationTable parameter to perform a batched change of content location.
     |      
     |      When implementing getExternalContent, you are responsible for forwarding the call to the base class when it makes sense to do so, so that base classes  can also add their external content to the table.
     |      
     |      The default implementation does nothing.
     |      
     |      * table [OUT] (MExternalContentInfoTable) - Content information table that this method must populate.
     |  
     |  getFilesToArchive(...)
     |      getFilesToArchive(shortName=False, unresolvedName=False, markCouldBeImageSequence=False) -> list of strings
     |      
     |      Use this method to return all external files used by this node. This file list will be used by the File > Archive zip feature, maya.exe -archive and the `file -q -list` mel command.
     |      
     |      Only include files that exist.
     |      
     |      If shortName is True, return just the filename portion of the path. Otherwise, return a full path.
     |      
     |      If unresolvedName is True, return the path before any resolution has been done (i.e leave it as a relative path, include unexpanded environment variables,  tildes, ".."s etc). Otherwise, resolve the file     path and return an absolute path (to resolve with standard Maya path resolution, use MFileObject.resolvedFullName()).
     |      
     |      * shortName (bool) - If True, only add the filename of the path.
     |      * unresolvedName (bool) - If True, add paths before any resolution, rather than absolute paths.
     |      * markCouldBeImageSequence (bool) - If True, append an asterisk after any file path that could be an image sequence (note: only used by maya.exe -archive).
     |  
     |  getInternalValue(...)
     |      getInternalValue(plug, dataHandle) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is overridden by nodes that store attribute data in some internal format.
     |      
     |      The internal state of attributes can be set or queried using the setInternal and internal methods of MFnAttribute.
     |      
     |      When internal attribute values are queried via getAttr or MPlug.getValue() this method is called.
     |      
     |      All internal data should respect the current context, which may be obtained from MDGContext::current()
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being queried.
     |      * dataHandle [OUT] (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle to store the attribute value.

     |  getInternalValueInContext(...)
     |      getInternalValueInContext(plug, dataHandle, ctx) -> bool [OBSOLETE]
     |      
     |      This method is obsolete. Override MPxNode.getInternalValue instead.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being queried.
     |      * dataHandle [OUT] (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle to store the attribute value.
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - the context the method is being evaluated in.
     |  
     |  internalArrayCount(...)
     |      internalArrayCount(plug) -> int
     |      internalArrayCount(plug, ctx) -> int  [OBSOLETE]
     |      
     |      This method is overridden by nodes that have internal array attributes which are not stored in Maya's datablock. This method is used by Maya to determine the non-sparse count of array elements during file IO. If the internal array is stored sparsely, you should return the maximum index of the array plus one. If the internal array is non-sparse then return the length of the array.
     |      
     |      This method does not need to be implemented for attributes that are stored in the datablock since Maya will use the datablock size.
     |      
     |      If this method is overridden, it should return -1 for attributes which it does not handle. Maya will use the datablock size to determine the array length when -1 is returned.
     |      
     |      All internal data should respect the current context, which may be obtained from MDGContext.current()
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the array plug.
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - the context, default to MDGContext.current().
     |  
     |  isAbstractClass(...)
     |      isAbstractClass() -> bool
     |      
     |      Override this class to return True if this node is an abstract node. An abstract node can only be used as a base class.  It cannot be created using the 'createNode' command.
     |      
     |      It is not necessary to override this method.
     |  
     |  isPassiveOutput(...)
     |      isPassiveOutput(plug) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method may be overridden by the user defined node if it wants to provide output attributes which do not prevent value modifications to the destination attribute. For example, output plugs on animation curve nodes are passive. This allows the attributes driven by the animation curves to be set to new values by the user.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug representing output in question.
     |  
     |  legalConnection(...)
     |      legalConnection(plug, otherPlug, asSrc) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method allows you to check for legal connections being made to attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      You should return None to specify that maya should handle this connection if you are unable to determine if it is legal.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (bool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  legalDisconnection(...)
     |      legalDisconnection(plug, otherPlug, arsSrc) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method allows you to check for legal disconnections being made to attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      You should return None to specify that maya should handle this disconnection if you are unable to determine if it is legal.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (boool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  name(...)
     |      name() -> string
     |      
     |      Returns the name of this particular instance of this class.  Each objectin the dependency graph has a name.  This name will be used by the UIand by MEL.
     |      
     |      It is not necessary to override this method.
     |      
     |      Returns the name of the node
     |  
     |  passThroughToMany(...)
     |      passThroughToMany(plug, plugArray) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is overriden by nodes that want to control the traversal behavior of some Maya search algorithms which traverse the history/future of shape nodes looking for directly related nodes. In particular, the Artisan paint code uses this method when searching for paintable nodes, and the disk cache code uses this method when searching for upstream cacheFile nodes.
     |      
     |      If this method is not implemented or returns False, the base class Maya implementation of this method calls passThroughToOne and returns the results of that call.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the plug.
     |      * plugArray (MPlugArray) - the corresponding plugs.
     |  
     |  passThroughToOne(...)
     |      passThroughToOne(plug) -> plug
     |      
     |      This method may be overriden by nodes that have a one-to-one relationship between an input attribute and a corresponding output attribute. This method is used by Maya to perform the following capabilities:
     |      
     |      - When this node is deleted, the delete command will rewire the source of the input attribute to the destination of the output attribute if the source and destination are connected to nodes that are not deleted.
     |      - History traversal algorithms such as the bakePartialHistory command use this method to direct its traversal through a shape's construction history.
     |      - The base class Maya implementation of passThroughToAll will call this method if passThroughToAll returns False.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the plug.
     |  
     |  postConstructor(...)
     |      postConstructor() -> self
     |      
     |      Internally maya creates two objects when a user defined node is created, the internal MObject and the user derived object.
     |      The association between the these two objects is not made until after the MPxNode constructor is called. This implies that no MPxNode member function can be called from the MPxNode constructor.
     |      The postConstructor will get called immediately after the constructor when it is safe to call any MPxNode member function.
     |  
     |  postEvaluation(...)
     |      postEvaluation(context, evalNode, evalType) -> None
     |      
     |      Clean up node's internal state after threaded evaluation.
     |      
     |      After the evaluation graph execution, each node gets a chance to restore / update its internal states.For example, resetting draw state.
     |      
     |      This code has to be thread safe, non - blocking and work only on data owned by the node.
     |      
     |      This call will most likely happen from a worker thread.
     |      
     |      * context (MDGContext) - Context in which the evaluation is happening.
     |                               This should be respected and only internal state
     |                               information pertaining to it should be modified.
     |      * evaluationNode (MEvaluationNode) - Evaluation node which contains
     |                                           information about the dirty plugs the
     |                                           dirty plugs that were evaluated for this
     |                                           context.
     |      * evalType (PostEvaluationType)
     |        * kEvaluatedIndirectly : The node's compute function handled evaluation.
     |        * kEvaluatedDirectly   : Evaluation was performed externally and the results injected
     |                                 back into the node.  This would happen in situations such as
     |                                 extracting values from an external cache.The node needs to
     |                                 update any additional internal state based on the new values.
     |        * kLeaveDirty          : Evaluation was performed without updating this node. Internal
     |                                 state should be updated to reflect that the node is dirty.
     |  
     |  preEvaluation(...)
     |      preEvaluation(context, evalNode) -> None
     |      
     |      Prepare a node's internal state for threaded evaluation.
     |      
     |      During the evaluation graph execution each node gets a chance to reset its internal states just before being evaluated.
     |      
     |      This code has to be thread safe, non - blocking and work only on data owned by the node.
     |      
     |      The timing of this callback is at the discretion of evaluation graph dependencies and individual evaluators.This means, it should be used purely to prepare this node for evaluation and no particular order should be assumed.
     |      
     |      This call will most likely happen from a worker thread.
     |      
     |      * context (MDGContext) - Context in which the evaluation is happening.
     |                               This should be respected and only internal state
     |                               information pertaining to it should be modified.
     |      * evaluationNode (MEvaluationNode) - Evaluation node which contains
     |                                           information about the dirty plugs that
     |                                           are about to be evaluated for the context.
     |                                           Should be only used to query information.
     |  
     |  setDependentsDirty(...)
     |      setDependentsDirty(plug, plugArray) -> self
     |      
     |      This method can be overridden in user defined nodes to specify which plugs should be set dirty based upon an input plug which Maya is marking dirty. The list of plugs for Maya to mark dirty is returned by the plug array. This method handles both dynamic as well as non-dynamic plugs and is useful in the following ways:
     |      
     |      
     |      
     |      - Allows attributeAffects-style relationships to be handled for dynamically-added attributes. Since MPxNode.attributeAffects() can only be used with non-dynamic attributes, use of this method allows a way for all attributes of a node to affect one another, both dynamic and non-dynamic.
     |      
     |      - Provides more flexible relationships than what is available with MPxNode.attributeAffects(). For example, you may wish to not dirty plugs when the current frame is one. However, as the routine is called during dirty propagation, there are restrictions on what can be done within the routine, most importantly you must not cause any dependency graph computation. For details, see the IMPORTANT NOTE below.
     |      
     |      
     |      
     |      This method is designed to work harmoniously with MPxNode.attributeAffects() on the same node. Alternately, you can do all affects relationships within a yourNode.setDependentsDirty() implementation.
     |      
     |      The body of a user-implemented setDependentsDirty() implementation might look like the following example, which causes the plug called "B" to be set dirty whever plug "A" is changed, i.e. A affects B.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug which is being set dirty by Maya.
     |      * plugArray the programmer should add any plugs which they want to set dirty to this list.
     |  
     |  setDoNotWrite(...)
     |      setDoNotWrite(bool) -> self
     |      
     |      Use this method to mark the "do not write" state of this proxy node.  If set, this node will not be saved when the Maya model is written out. 
     |      
     |      NOTES:
     |      1. Plug-in "requires" information will be written out with the model when saved.  But a subsequent reload and resave of the file will cause these to go away.
     |      2. If this node is a DAG and has a parent or children, the "do not write" flag of the parent or children will not be set. It is the developer's responsibility to ensure that the resulting scene file is capable of being read in without errors due to unwritten nodes.
     |  
     |  setExternalContent(...)
     |      setExternalContent(table) -> self
     |      
     |      This is useful in the context of content relocation.  This will be called while the scene is being loaded to apply path changes performed externally. Consequently, interaction with the rest of the scene must be kept to a minimum.  It is however valid to call this method outside of scene loading contexts.
     |      
     |      The keys in the map must be the same as the ones provided by the node in getExternalContent.  The values are the new locations.
     |      
     |      When implementing setExternalContent, you are responsible for forwarding the call to the base class when it makes sense to do so, so that base classes  can also set their external content.
     |      
     |      The default implementation does nothing.
     |      
     |      * table Key->location table with new content locations.
     |  
     |  setExternalContentForFileAttr(...)
     |      setExternalContentForFileAttr(attr, table) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is a helper for derived clases implementing setExternalContent().  It assigns a value to a plug with the one from the table whose key is the same as the passed in attribute name.
     |      
     |      The method will not write to the plug if the attribute is not found in the  table.
     |      
     |      * attr (MObject) - The attribute of the plug we want to write to.
     |      * table (MExternalContentLocationTable) - A table which may hold or not the value for a given plug.
     |      
     |      Returns True if the plug was successfully written to. False if no entry in the table was named after the attribute or if no plug was found.
     |  
     |  setInternalValue(...)
     |      setInternalValue(plug, dataHandle) -> bool
     |      
     |      
     |      This method is overriden by nodes that store attribute data in some internal format.
     |      
     |      The internal state of attributes can be set or queried using the setInternal and internal methods of MFnAttribute.
     |      
     |      When internal attribute values are set via setAttr or MPlug.setValue() this method is called.
     |      
     |      Another use for this method is to impose attribute limits.
     |      
     |      All internal data should respect the current context, which may be obtained from MDGContext::current()
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being set.
     |      * dataHandle (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle containing the value to set.
     |  
     |  setInternalValueInContext(...)
     |      setInternalValueInContext(plug, dataHandle, ctx) -> bool  [OBSOLETE]
     |      
     |      This method is obsolete. Override MPxNode.setInternalValue instead.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being set.
     |      * dataHandle (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle containing the value to set.
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - the context the method is being evaluated in.
     |  
     |  setMPSafe(...)
     |      setMPSafe(bool) -> self
     |      
     |      This method is obsolete. Override MPxNode.setSchedulingType instead.
     |      
     |      Set a flag to specify if a user defined shading node is safe for multi-processor rendering. For a shading node to be MP safe, it cannot access any shared global data and should only use attributes in the datablock to get input data and store output data. 
     |      
     |      NOTE: This should be called from the postConstructor() method for shading node plug-ins only. If a shading node is non-safe, then it will only be useful during single processor rendering.
     |  
     |  shouldSave(...)
     |      shouldSave(plug) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method may be overridden by the user defined node.  It should only be required to override this on rare occasions.
     |      
     |      This method determines whether a specific attribute of this node should be written out during a file save.  The default behavior is to only write the value if it differs from the default and is not being supplied by a connection.  This behavior should be sufficient in most cases.
     |      This method is not called for ramp attributes since they should always be written.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug representing the attribute to be saved.
     |  
     |  thisMObject(...)
     |      thisMObject() -> MObject
     |      
     |      Returns the MObject associated with this user defined node.  This makes it possible to use MFnDependencyNode or to construct plugs to this node's attributes.
     |  
     |  type(...)
     |      type() -> int
     |      
     |      Returns the type of node that this is.  This is used to differentiate user defined nodes that are derived off different MPx base classes.
     |      
     |      It is not necessary to override this method.
     |

     |  
     |  typeId(...)
     |      typeId() -> MTypeId
     |      
     |      Returns the TYPEID of this node.
     |  
     |  typeName(...)
     |      typeName() -> string
     |      
     |      Returns the type name of this node.  The type name identifies the node type to the ASCII file format

     |  Static methods inherited from OpenMaya.MPxNode:
     |  
     |  addAttribute(...)
     |      addAttribute(attr) -> None
     |      
     |      This method adds a new attribute to a user defined node type during the type's initialization.
     |      
     |      This method will only work during the static initialization method of the user defined node class.  The initialization method is the one that is passed into  MFnPlugin.registerNode(). The attributes must first be created using one of the MFnAttribute classes, and can then be added using this method.
     |      
     |      For compound attributes, the proper way to use this method is by calling it with the parent attribute. If a compound attribute is passed, this method will add all of its children.
     |      NOTE: A failure will occur if you attempt to call addAttribute() on the children of a compound attribute.
     |      
     |      * attr (MObject) - new attribute to add.
     |  
     |  attributeAffects(...)
     |      attributeAffects(whenChanges, isAffected) -> None
     |      
     |      This method specifies that a particular input attribute affects a specific output attribute.  This is required to make evaluation efficient.  When an input changes, only the affected outputs will be computed. Output attributes cannot be keyable - if they are keyable, this method will fail.
     |      
     |      This method must be called for every attribute dependency when initializing the node's attributes.  The attributes must first be added using the MPxNode.addAttribute() method.  Failing to call this method will cause the node not to update when its inputs change. If there are no calls to this method in a node's initialization, then the compute method will never be called.

     |      This method will only work during the static initialization method of the user defined node class.  The initialization method is the one that is passed into MFnPlugin.registerNode().  As a result, it does not work with dynamic attributes. For an alternate solution which handles dynamic as well as non-dynamic attributes refer to MPxNode.setDependentsDirty.()

     |  inheritAttributesFrom(...)
     |      inheritAttributesFrom(parentClassName) -> None
     |      
     |      This method allows a class of plugin node to inherit all of the attributes of a second class of plugin node.
     |      
     |      This method will only work during the static initialization method of the user defined node class and must be called before any other attributes have been added.  The initialization method is the one that is passed into  MFnPlugin.registerNode().
     |      
     |      A plugin node may only inherit attributes from one other class of plugin node. Attempting to call this method multiple times within a node's initialization method will result in an error.
     |      
     |      Both node classes must be registered using the same MPxNode type, listed in MPxNode.type().
     |

     |  
     |  drawUV(...)
     |      drawUV(view, info) -> self
     |      
     |      This method is called when the surface shape is selected and the texture view is open.  Users should override this method if their custom shape supports UVs.
     |      
     |      * view (M3dView) - Texture view in which to draw UVs.
     |      * info (MTextureEditorDrawInfo) - Drawing parameters.

     |  
     |  materials(...)
     |      materials(path, componentFilter, materials, componentSet=None) -> self
     |      
     |      Returns the material associated with this shape.
     |      The user must supply a DAG path as a shape can have several materials if instanced.
     |      
     |      * path (MDagPath) - the path for which to get the material
     |  
     |  select(...)
     |      select(selectInfo, selectionList, worldSpaceSelectPts) -> bool
     |      
     |      This routine must be overriden if the shape is to support interactive object and/or component selection. The implementation of this method should call selectInfo.addSelection with information about the selected item and its selection mask. For single click selection, detected using the selectInfo.singleSection() method, the hit point should also be passed as an argument to selectInfo.addSelection().
     |      
     |      Returns True if something was selected.
     |      
     |      * selectInfo (MSelectInfo) - the Selection state information.
     |      * selectionList [OUT] (MSelectionList) - List of items selected by this method. Do not update directly: use MSelectInfo.addSelection instead.
     |      * worldSpaceSelectPts [OUT] (MPointArray) - List of points used to sort corresponding selections in single-select mode. (Closest to camera wins.) Do not update directly: use MSelectInfo.addSelection instead.
     |  
     |  selectUV(...)
     |      selectUV(view, selType, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax, singleSelect, selList) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is called when the user performs a selection within the texture view.  The method is called only when the surface shape is member of the active selection list.
     |      
     |      Maya provides the current viewport instance, the type of the selection, the extents of the selection rectangle (in viewport coordinates), and if the selection mode is single selection. The API user is expected to fill the selection list and return a result of True if 'something was selected'.
     |      
     |      To properly use this method, you must make sure that you have a valid component type that Maya can recognize. Selection tests can be done using a pick buffer or by spatially determining the selected objects.
     |      
     |      Currently Maya does not know how to manipulate custom UV components. This method only provides the facilities to visualize what has been selected in the viewport.  The API user is responsible for implementing commands that can manipulate the currently selected UVs.
     |      
     |      Returns True if something was selected.
     |      
     |      * view (M3dView) - the texture drawing view
     |      * selType (int) - the selection type
     |      * xmin (int) - minimum x coordinate value of the selection rectangle.
     |      * ymin (int) - minimum y coordinate value of the selection rectangle.
     |      * xmax (int) - maximum x coordinate value of the selection rectangle.
     |      * ymax (int) - maximum y coordinate value of the selection rectangle.
     |      * singleSelect (bool) - indicates if the user is in single selection mode.
     |      * selList [OUT] (MSelectionList) - the selection list to be populated.
     |      
     |      Valid selection types:
     |        kSelectMeshUVs      The UV selection type is UVs.
     |        kSelectMeshVerts    The UV selection type is vertices.
     |        kSelectMeshFaces    The UV selection type is faces.
     |        kSelectMeshEdges    The UV selection type is edges.
     |  
     |  snap(...)
     |      snap(snapInfo) -> bool
     |      
     |      Maya calls this method when snapping to the shape's vertices.
     |      If you wish your custom shape to support point snapping then you must override this method and have it call snapInfo's MSelectInfo.setSnapPoint() method to set the point to be snapped to.
     |      If setSnapPoint() is called multiple times then the point closest to the cursor will be used.
     |      
     |      Returns True if a vertex was found to be snapped to was selected.
     |      
     |      * snapInfo (MSelectInfo) - the Selection state information.

     |  boundingBox(...)
     |      boundingBox() -> MBoundingBox
     |      
     |      This method should be overridden to return a bounding box for the locator.
     |      If this method is overridden, then MPxLocatorNode.isBounded should also be overridden to return True.
     |  
     |  closestPoint(...)
     |      closestPoint(rayPoint, rayDir) -> MPoint
     |      
     |      Returns the point on the locator, in the locator's local space, which is closest along the specified ray.
     |      
     |      By default, the locator's origin (0, 0, 0) is returned.
     |      
     |      This is currently only used by Maya during single selection. See useClosestPointForSelection() for further details on that.
     |      
     |      * rayPoint (MPoint) - The base point defining the ray in space
     |      * rayDir (MVector) - The ray direction in space
     |  
     |  color(...)
     |      color(status) -> int
     |      
     |      This method returns the index of the color that is the default draw color for the given display status.  The index should be used with the methods of M3dView.  The value is not an index into the OpenGL color table. 
     |      
     |      The index that is returned will be into the active, dormant, or template color tables depending on the display status passed in.
     |      
     |      * displayStatus (int) - display status. See M3dView.displayStatus() for a list of valid status.
     |  
     |  colorRGB(...)
     |      colorRGB(status) -> MColor
     |      
     |      This method returns the RGB values of the default draw color for the given display status.
     |      
     |      * displayStatus (int) - display status. See M3dView.displayStatus() for a list of valid status.
     |  
     |  draw(...)
     |      draw(view, path, style, status) -> self
     |      
     |      Overriding this method allows the drawing of custom geometry using standard OpenGL calls.  The OpenGL state should be left in the same state that it was in previously.  The OpenGL routine glPushAttrib may be used to make this easier.
     |      
     |      When this routine is called, the following conditions may be assumed:
     |       - the correct transform matrix will be loaded for the locator, so the geometry should be drawn in local space
     |       - the correct default color will be set for wire frame drawing given the object's state (eg active, dormant, etc.)
     |       - the object is not invisible or hidden
     |       - if the object has a bounding box, then the bounding box is at least partially in the frustum
     |      
     |      
     |      As a convenience, this draw method will also be used by OpenGL's selection mechanism to determine whether this object gets selected by a particular mouse event.  The user does not need to write a separate selection routine.
     |      
     |      * view (M3dView) - 3D view that is being drawn into.
     |      * path (MDagPath) - to the parent (transform node) of this locator in the DAG.
     |      If there is a shape node parented directly beneath the transform node, you can access it 
     |      by calling MDagPath.extendToShape(). 
     |      * style (int) - style to draw object in. See M3dView.displayStyle() for a list of valid styles.
     |      * status (int) - selection status of object. See M3dView.displayStatus() for a list of valid status.
     |  
     |  drawLast(...)
     |      drawLast() -> bool
     |      
     |      Indicates that this locator should be the last item draw in a given refresh cycle.  Objects drawn out-of-order will not preserve the proper transparency sorting.  Conflicts among multiple objects with the drawLast indicator set to TRUE will be resolved by their order in the Outliner, where they will be drawn top-to-bottom.
     |      
     |      The default return value is True.
     |  
     |  excludeAsLocator(...)
     |      excludeAsLocator() -> bool
     |      
     |      When the modelPanel is set to not draw locators, returing True will also not draw the custom locator. If False is returned, the custom locator will also be drawn.
     |      
     |      The default return value is True.
     |  
     |  getShapeSelectionMask(...)
     |      getShapeSelectionMask() -> MSelectionMask
     |      
     |      This routine can be overridden to provide information aboutthe selection mask of the locator. By default the selection maskfor locators is returned.
     |  
     |  isBounded(...)
     |      isBounded() -> bool
     |      
     |      This method should be overridden to return True if the user supplies a bounding box routine.  Supplying a bounding box routine makes refresh and selection more efficient.
     |  
     |  isTransparent(...)
     |      isTransparent() -> bool
     |      
     |      Indicates that this locator uses transparency during ::draw method calls. Objects with transparency must be drawn in a special queue, i.e. after all opaque objects are drawn.
     |      
     |      The default return value is False.
     |  
     |  useClosestPointForSelection(...)
     |      useClosestPointForSelection() -> bool
     |      
     |      Determines whether Maya should call closestPoint() when doing single selection.
     |      
     |      When doing single selection Maya generally chooses the object closest to the selection ray. For locators it first does a hit test by calling the locator's draw method to determine if any part of it lies within the selection box. If the hit test succeeds Maya will add the locator to the list of objects being considered for selection and will use the center of the locator (i.e. its local origin) in determining its distance from the selection ray. This works well for locators which mark a single point in space, with no offset, but may not work as well for more complex locators.
     |      
     |      If this method is overridden to return True, then rather than using the locator's center to determine its distance from the selection ray, Maya will pass the ray to the closestPoint() method and use the point it returns. Note that you will have override closestPoint() as well to provide an appropriate point.

     |  addExternalContentForFileAttr(...)
     |      addExternalContentForFileAttr(table, attr) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is a helper for derived clases implementing getExternalContent().  It augments the external content info table passed in with an entry describing external content whose location is described by the specified attribute.
     |      
     |      The method will not overwrite existing items, i.e. items with the same key. (attribute name).  In this context, overwriting an item means the caller has called this function twice with the same attribute, or that two separate but identically named attributes were used.  If replacing an entry is the desired effect, it is the caller's responsibility to erase the previous item first.

     |      * attr (MObject) - The attribute for which the plug value will be queried for a location.
     |      
     |      Returns True if an item was sucessfully added to the table.  False if the attribute does not describe a non-empty location, or an item with the same key was already present in the table.
     |  
     |  compute(...)
     |      compute(plug, dataBlock) -> self
     |      
     |      This method should be overridden in user defined nodes.
     |      
     |      Recompute the given output based on the nodes inputs.  The plug represents the data value that needs to be recomputed, and the data block holds the storage for all of the node's attributes.
     |      
     |      The MDataBlock will provide smart handles for reading and writing this node's attribute values.  Only these values should be used when performing computations.
     |      
     |      When evaluating the dependency graph, Maya will first call the compute method for this node.  If the plug that is provided to the compute indicates that that the attribute was defined by the Maya parent node, the compute method should return None.  When this occurs, Maya will call the internal Maya node from which the user-defined node is derived to compute the plug's value. Returning any othervalue (including self) will tell Maya that this node successfully computed theplug. Raising an exception will tell Maya that this node failed at computingthe plug. Note that in most cases, Maya ignores node compute failures.
     |      
     |      In other words, the compute method should return None to get the Maya parent class to compute the plug. It should return self (or any other value) to indicate that the plug was computed successfully.
     |      
     |      This means that a user defined node does not need to be concerned with computing inherited output attributes.  However, if desired, these can be safely recomputed by this method to change the behaviour of the node.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug representing the attribute that needs to be recomputed.
     |      * block (MDataBlock) - data block containing storage for the node's attributes.
     |  
     |  connectionBroken(...)
     |      connectionBroken( plug, otherPlug, asSrc) -> self
     |      
     |      This method gets called when connections are broken with attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (bool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  connectionMade(...)
     |      connectionMade(plug, otherPlug, asSrc) -> self
     |      
     |      This method gets called when connections are made to attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (bool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  copyInternalData(...)
     |      copyInternalData(node) -> self
     |      
     |      This method is overriden by nodes that store attribute data in some internal format.
     |      
     |      On duplication this method is called on the duplicated node with the node being duplicated passed as the parameter.  Overriding this method gives your node a chance to duplicate any internal data you've been storing and manipulating outside of normal attribute data.
     |      
     |      * node (MPxNode) - the node that is being duplicated.
     |  
     |  dependsOn(...)
     |      dependsOn( plug, otherPlug) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method may be overridden by the user defined node. It should only be required to override this on rare occasions.
     |      
     |      This method determines whether a specific attribute depends on another attribute.
     |      
     |      You should return None to specify that Maya should determines the dependency (default).
     |      
     |      This is mainly to define dependency of dynamic attributes, since attributeAffects does not work with dynamic attributes.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |  
     |  doNotWrite(...)
     |      doNotWrite() -> bool
     |      
     |      use this method to query the "do not write" state of this proxy node. True is returned if this node will not be saved when the maya model is written out.
     |  
     |  forceCache(...)
     |      forceCache(ctx=MDGContext::current()) -> MDataBlock
     |      
     |      Get the datablock for this node. If there is no datablock then one will be created.
     |      NOTE: This should be used only in places where fast access to the datablock outside of a compute is critical such as the transformUsing method of MPxSurfaceShape.
     |      
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - The context in which the datablock will be retrieved.
     |  
     |  getExternalContent(...)
     |      getExternalContent(table) -> self
     |      
     |      The table populated by this method must include the location of all the content (files) used by this node, including those that do not exist.  See MExternalContentInfoTable for details.
     |      
     |      Keys used to add items to this table will be the same that get passed to setExternalContent through its MExternalContentLocationTable parameter to perform a batched change of content location.
     |      
     |      When implementing getExternalContent, you are responsible for forwarding the call to the base class when it makes sense to do so, so that base classes  can also add their external content to the table.
     |      
     |      The default implementation does nothing.
     |      
     |      * table [OUT] (MExternalContentInfoTable) - Content information table that this method must populate.
     |  
     |  getFilesToArchive(...)
     |      getFilesToArchive(shortName=False, unresolvedName=False, markCouldBeImageSequence=False) -> list of strings
     |      
     |      Use this method to return all external files used by this node. This file list will be used by the File > Archive zip feature, maya.exe -archive and the `file -q -list` mel command.
     |      
     |      Only include files that exist.
     |      
     |      If shortName is True, return just the filename portion of the path. Otherwise, return a full path.
     |      
     |      If unresolvedName is True, return the path before any resolution has been done (i.e leave it as a relative path, include unexpanded environment variables,  tildes, ".."s etc). Otherwise, resolve the file     path and return an absolute path (to resolve with standard Maya path resolution, use MFileObject.resolvedFullName()).
     |      
     |      * shortName (bool) - If True, only add the filename of the path.
     |      * unresolvedName (bool) - If True, add paths before any resolution, rather than absolute paths.
     |      * markCouldBeImageSequence (bool) - If True, append an asterisk after any file path that could be an image sequence (note: only used by maya.exe -archive).
     |  
     |  getInternalValue(...)
     |      getInternalValue(plug, dataHandle) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is overridden by nodes that store attribute data in some internal format.
     |      
     |      The internal state of attributes can be set or queried using the setInternal and internal methods of MFnAttribute.
     |      
     |      When internal attribute values are queried via getAttr or MPlug.getValue() this method is called.
     |      
     |      All internal data should respect the current context, which may be obtained from MDGContext::current()
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being queried.
     |      * dataHandle [OUT] (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle to store the attribute value.
     |  
     |  getInternalValueInContext(...)
     |      getInternalValueInContext(plug, dataHandle, ctx) -> bool [OBSOLETE]
     |      
     |      This method is obsolete. Override MPxNode.getInternalValue instead.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being queried.
     |      * dataHandle [OUT] (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle to store the attribute value.
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - the context the method is being evaluated in.
     |  
     |  internalArrayCount(...)
     |      internalArrayCount(plug) -> int
     |      internalArrayCount(plug, ctx) -> int  [OBSOLETE]
     |      
     |      This method is overridden by nodes that have internal array attributes which are not stored in Maya's datablock. This method is used by Maya to determine the non-sparse count of array elements during file IO. If the internal array is stored sparsely, you should return the maximum index of the array plus one. If the internal array is non-sparse then return the length of the array.
     |      
     |      This method does not need to be implemented for attributes that are stored in the datablock since Maya will use the datablock size.
     |      
     |      If this method is overridden, it should return -1 for attributes which it does not handle. Maya will use the datablock size to determine the array length when -1 is returned.
     |      
     |      All internal data should respect the current context, which may be obtained from MDGContext.current()
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the array plug.
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - the context, default to MDGContext.current().
     |  
     |  isAbstractClass(...)
     |      isAbstractClass() -> bool
     |      
     |      Override this class to return True if this node is an abstract node. An abstract node can only be used as a base class.  It cannot be created using the 'createNode' command.
     |      
     |      It is not necessary to override this method.
     |  
     |  isPassiveOutput(...)
     |      isPassiveOutput(plug) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method may be overridden by the user defined node if it wants to provide output attributes which do not prevent value modifications to the destination attribute. For example, output plugs on animation curve nodes are passive. This allows the attributes driven by the animation curves to be set to new values by the user.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug representing output in question.
     |  
     |  legalConnection(...)
     |      legalConnection(plug, otherPlug, asSrc) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method allows you to check for legal connections being made to attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      You should return None to specify that maya should handle this connection if you are unable to determine if it is legal.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (bool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  legalDisconnection(...)
     |      legalDisconnection(plug, otherPlug, arsSrc) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method allows you to check for legal disconnections being made to attributes of this node.
     |      
     |      You should return None to specify that maya should handle this disconnection if you are unable to determine if it is legal.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - attribute on this node.
     |      * otherPlug (MPlug) - attribute on other node.
     |      * asSrc (boool) - is this plug a source of the connection.
     |  
     |  name(...)
     |      name() -> string
     |      
     |      Returns the name of this particular instance of this class.  Each objectin the dependency graph has a name.  This name will be used by the UIand by MEL.
     |      
     |      It is not necessary to override this method.
     |      
     |      Returns the name of the node
     |  
     |  passThroughToMany(...)
     |      passThroughToMany(plug, plugArray) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is overriden by nodes that want to control the traversal behavior of some Maya search algorithms which traverse the history/future of shape nodes looking for directly related nodes. In particular, the Artisan paint code uses this method when searching for paintable nodes, and the disk cache code uses this method when searching for upstream cacheFile nodes.
     |      
     |      If this method is not implemented or returns False, the base class Maya implementation of this method calls passThroughToOne and returns the results of that call.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the plug.
     |      * plugArray (MPlugArray) - the corresponding plugs.
     |  
     |  passThroughToOne(...)
     |      passThroughToOne(plug) -> plug
     |      
     |      This method may be overriden by nodes that have a one-to-one relationship between an input attribute and a corresponding output attribute. This method is used by Maya to perform the following capabilities:
     |      
     |      - When this node is deleted, the delete command will rewire the source of the input attribute to the destination of the output attribute if the source and destination are connected to nodes that are not deleted.
     |      - History traversal algorithms such as the bakePartialHistory command use this method to direct its traversal through a shape's construction history.
     |      - The base class Maya implementation of passThroughToAll will call this method if passThroughToAll returns False.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the plug.
     |  
     |  postConstructor(...)
     |      postConstructor() -> self
     |      
     |      Internally maya creates two objects when a user defined node is created, the internal MObject and the user derived object.
     |      The association between the these two objects is not made until after the MPxNode constructor is called. This implies that no MPxNode member function can be called from the MPxNode constructor.
     |      The postConstructor will get called immediately after the constructor when it is safe to call any MPxNode member function.
     |  
     |  postEvaluation(...)
     |      postEvaluation(context, evalNode, evalType) -> None
     |      
     |      Clean up node's internal state after threaded evaluation.
     |      
     |      After the evaluation graph execution, each node gets a chance to restore / update its internal states.For example, resetting draw state.
     |      
     |      This code has to be thread safe, non - blocking and work only on data owned by the node.
     |      
     |      This call will most likely happen from a worker thread.
     |      
     |      * context (MDGContext) - Context in which the evaluation is happening.
     |                               This should be respected and only internal state
     |                               information pertaining to it should be modified.
     |      * evaluationNode (MEvaluationNode) - Evaluation node which contains
     |                                           information about the dirty plugs the
     |                                           dirty plugs that were evaluated for this
     |                                           context.
     |      * evalType (PostEvaluationType)
     |        * kEvaluatedIndirectly : The node's compute function handled evaluation.
     |        * kEvaluatedDirectly   : Evaluation was performed externally and the results injected
     |                                 back into the node.  This would happen in situations such as
     |                                 extracting values from an external cache.The node needs to
     |                                 update any additional internal state based on the new values.
     |        * kLeaveDirty          : Evaluation was performed without updating this node. Internal
     |                                 state should be updated to reflect that the node is dirty.
     |  
     |  preEvaluation(...)
     |      preEvaluation(context, evalNode) -> None
     |      
     |      Prepare a node's internal state for threaded evaluation.
     |      
     |      During the evaluation graph execution each node gets a chance to reset its internal states just before being evaluated.
     |      
     |      This code has to be thread safe, non - blocking and work only on data owned by the node.
     |      
     |      The timing of this callback is at the discretion of evaluation graph dependencies and individual evaluators.This means, it should be used purely to prepare this node for evaluation and no particular order should be assumed.
     |      
     |      This call will most likely happen from a worker thread.
     |      
     |      * context (MDGContext) - Context in which the evaluation is happening.
     |                               This should be respected and only internal state
     |                               information pertaining to it should be modified.
     |      * evaluationNode (MEvaluationNode) - Evaluation node which contains
     |                                           information about the dirty plugs that
     |                                           are about to be evaluated for the context.
     |                                           Should be only used to query information.
     |  
     |  setDependentsDirty(...)
     |      setDependentsDirty(plug, plugArray) -> self
     |      
     |      This method can be overridden in user defined nodes to specify which plugs should be set dirty based upon an input plug which Maya is marking dirty. The list of plugs for Maya to mark dirty is returned by the plug array. This method handles both dynamic as well as non-dynamic plugs and is useful in the following ways:
     |      
     |      
     |      
     |      - Allows attributeAffects-style relationships to be handled for dynamically-added attributes. Since MPxNode.attributeAffects() can only be used with non-dynamic attributes, use of this method allows a way for all attributes of a node to affect one another, both dynamic and non-dynamic.
     |      
     |      - Provides more flexible relationships than what is available with MPxNode.attributeAffects(). For example, you may wish to not dirty plugs when the current frame is one. However, as the routine is called during dirty propagation, there are restrictions on what can be done within the routine, most importantly you must not cause any dependency graph computation. For details, see the IMPORTANT NOTE below.
     |      
     |      
     |      
     |      This method is designed to work harmoniously with MPxNode.attributeAffects() on the same node. Alternately, you can do all affects relationships within a yourNode.setDependentsDirty() implementation.
     |      
     |      The body of a user-implemented setDependentsDirty() implementation might look like the following example, which causes the plug called "B" to be set dirty whever plug "A" is changed, i.e. A affects B.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug which is being set dirty by Maya.
     |      * plugArray the programmer should add any plugs which they want to set dirty to this list.
     |  
     |  setDoNotWrite(...)
     |      setDoNotWrite(bool) -> self
     |      
     |      Use this method to mark the "do not write" state of this proxy node.  If set, this node will not be saved when the Maya model is written out. 
     |      
     |      NOTES:
     |      1. Plug-in "requires" information will be written out with the model when saved.  But a subsequent reload and resave of the file will cause these to go away.
     |      2. If this node is a DAG and has a parent or children, the "do not write" flag of the parent or children will not be set. It is the developer's responsibility to ensure that the resulting scene file is capable of being read in without errors due to unwritten nodes.
     |  
     |  setExternalContent(...)
     |      setExternalContent(table) -> self
     |      
     |      This is useful in the context of content relocation.  This will be called while the scene is being loaded to apply path changes performed externally. Consequently, interaction with the rest of the scene must be kept to a minimum.  It is however valid to call this method outside of scene loading contexts.
     |      
     |      The keys in the map must be the same as the ones provided by the node in getExternalContent.  The values are the new locations.
     |      
     |      When implementing setExternalContent, you are responsible for forwarding the call to the base class when it makes sense to do so, so that base classes  can also set their external content.
     |      
     |      The default implementation does nothing.
     |      
     |      * table Key->location table with new content locations.
     |  
     |  setExternalContentForFileAttr(...)
     |      setExternalContentForFileAttr(attr, table) -> bool
     |      
     |      This method is a helper for derived clases implementing setExternalContent().  It assigns a value to a plug with the one from the table whose key is the same as the passed in attribute name.
     |      
     |      The method will not write to the plug if the attribute is not found in the  table.
     |      
     |      * attr (MObject) - The attribute of the plug we want to write to.
     |      * table (MExternalContentLocationTable) - A table which may hold or not the value for a given plug.
     |      
     |      Returns True if the plug was successfully written to. False if no entry in the table was named after the attribute or if no plug was found.
     |  
     |  setInternalValue(...)
     |      setInternalValue(plug, dataHandle) -> bool
     |      
     |      
     |      This method is overriden by nodes that store attribute data in some internal format.
     |      
     |      The internal state of attributes can be set or queried using the setInternal and internal methods of MFnAttribute.
     |      
     |      When internal attribute values are set via setAttr or MPlug.setValue() this method is called.
     |      
     |      Another use for this method is to impose attribute limits.
     |      
     |      All internal data should respect the current context, which may be obtained from MDGContext::current()
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being set.
     |      * dataHandle (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle containing the value to set.
     |  
     |  setInternalValueInContext(...)
     |      setInternalValueInContext(plug, dataHandle, ctx) -> bool  [OBSOLETE]
     |      
     |      This method is obsolete. Override MPxNode.setInternalValue instead.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - the attribute that is being set.
     |      * dataHandle (MDataHandle) - the dataHandle containing the value to set.
     |      * ctx (MDGContext) - the context the method is being evaluated in.
     |  
     |  setMPSafe(...)
     |      setMPSafe(bool) -> self
     |      
     |      This method is obsolete. Override MPxNode.setSchedulingType instead.
     |      
     |      Set a flag to specify if a user defined shading node is safe for multi-processor rendering. For a shading node to be MP safe, it cannot access any shared global data and should only use attributes in the datablock to get input data and store output data. 
     |      
     |      NOTE: This should be called from the postConstructor() method for shading node plug-ins only. If a shading node is non-safe, then it will only be useful during single processor rendering.
     |  
     |  shouldSave(...)
     |      shouldSave(plug) -> bool/None
     |      
     |      This method may be overridden by the user defined node.  It should only be required to override this on rare occasions.
     |      
     |      This method determines whether a specific attribute of this node should be written out during a file save.  The default behavior is to only write the value if it differs from the default and is not being supplied by a connection.  This behavior should be sufficient in most cases.
     |      This method is not called for ramp attributes since they should always be written.
     |      
     |      * plug (MPlug) - plug representing the attribute to be saved.
     |  
     |  thisMObject(...)
     |      thisMObject() -> MObject
     |      
     |      Returns the MObject associated with this user defined node.  This makes it possible to use MFnDependencyNode or to construct plugs to this node's attributes.
     |  
     |  type(...)
     |      type() -> int
     |      
     |      Returns the type of node that this is.  This is used to differentiate user defined nodes that are derived off different MPx base classes.
     |      
     |      It is not necessary to override this method.

     |  Static methods inherited from OpenMaya.MPxNode:
     |  
     |  addAttribute(...)
     |      addAttribute(attr) -> None
     |      
     |      This method adds a new attribute to a user defined node type during the type's initialization.
     |      
     |      This method will only work during the static initialization method of the user defined node class.  The initialization method is the one that is passed into  MFnPlugin.registerNode(). The attributes must first be created using one of the MFnAttribute classes, and can then be added using this method.
     |      
     |      For compound attributes, the proper way to use this method is by calling it with the parent attribute. If a compound attribute is passed, this method will add all of its children.
     |      NOTE: A failure will occur if you attempt to call addAttribute() on the children of a compound attribute.
     |      
     |      * attr (MObject) - new attribute to add.
     |  
     |  attributeAffects(...)
     |      attributeAffects(whenChanges, isAffected) -> None
     |      
     |      This method specifies that a particular input attribute affects a specific output attribute.  This is required to make evaluation efficient.  When an input changes, only the affected outputs will be computed. Output attributes cannot be keyable - if they are keyable, this method will fail.
     |      
     |      This method must be called for every attribute dependency when initializing the node's attributes.  The attributes must first be added using the MPxNode.addAttribute() method.  Failing to call this method will cause the node not to update when its inputs change. If there are no calls to this method in a node's initialization, then the compute method will never be called.
     |      
     |      This method will only work during the static initialization method of the user defined node class.  The initialization method is the one that is passed into MFnPlugin.registerNode().  As a result, it does not work with dynamic attributes. For an alternate solution which handles dynamic as well as non-dynamic attributes refer to MPxNode.setDependentsDirty.()
     |      
     |      * whenChanges (MObject) - input attribute - MObject that points to an input attribute that has already been added.
     |      * isAffected (MObject) - affected output attribute - MObject that points to an output attribute that has already been added.
     |  
     |  inheritAttributesFrom(...)
     |      inheritAttributesFrom(parentClassName) -> None
     |      
     |      This method allows a class of plugin node to inherit all of the attributes of a second class of plugin node.
     |      
     |      This method will only work during the static initialization method of the user defined node class and must be called before any other attributes have been added.  The initialization method is the one that is passed into  MFnPlugin.registerNode().
     |      
     |      A plugin node may only inherit attributes from one other class of plugin node. Attempting to call this method multiple times within a node's initialization method will result in an error.
     |      
     |      Both node classes must be registered using the same MPxNode type, listed in MPxNode.type().
     |      
     |      * parentClassName (string) - class of node to inherit attributes from.
